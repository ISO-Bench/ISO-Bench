Running mypy on all target Python versions takes too long for local development. This PR reserves manual stage to be only run in pre-commit CI, and moves the mypy checks to manual stage. Meanwhile, a new commit hook is added to run mypy only on the current Python version. This hook is assigned to pre-commit stage so it is automatically run locally. This should make pre-commit take around the same time as the old format.sh . cc @hmellor Sorry, something went wrong. Uh oh! There was an error while loading. Please reload this page .

Thank you for contributing to the vLLM project. Just a reminder: PRs would not trigger full CI run by default. Instead, it would only run fastcheck CI which starts running only a small and essential subset of CI tests to quickly catch errors. You can run other CI tests on top of those by going to your fastcheck build on Buildkite UI (linked in the PR checks section) and unblock them. If you do not have permission to unblock, ping simon-mo or khluu to add you in our Buildkite org. Once the PR is approved and ready to go, your PR reviewer(s) can run CI to test the changes comprehensively before merging. To run CI, PR reviewers can do one of these: Add ready label to the PR Enable auto-merge. 🚀 All reactions Sorry, something went wrong. Uh oh! There was an error while loading.

Once the repo confirms to mypy better we can revert to running all python versions which is only 4 runs of mypy (i.e. quicker than running 1 python version today) All reactions Sorry, something went wrong.

Although it doesn't modify production source code APIs, it targets the performance of the CI/pre-commit pipeline by optimizing when and how these checks are run. These configurations are non-test files and the changes are non-trivial in optimizing CI performance. Therefore, this commit qualifies as performance/optimization related based on the intended speed improvements in the pre-commit process.",
