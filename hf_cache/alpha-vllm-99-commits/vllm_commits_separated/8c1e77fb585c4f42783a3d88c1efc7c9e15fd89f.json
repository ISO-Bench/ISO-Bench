Thank you for contributing to the vLLM project. Just a reminder: PRs would not trigger full CI run by default. Instead, it would only run fastcheck CI which starts running only a small and essential subset of CI tests to quickly catch errors. You can run other CI tests on top of those by going to your fastcheck build on Buildkite UI (linked in the PR checks section) and unblock them. If you do not have permission to unblock, ping simon-mo or khluu to add you in our Buildkite org. Once the PR is approved and ready to go, your PR reviewer(s) can run CI to test the changes comprehensively before merging. To run CI, PR reviewers can do one of these: Add ready label to the PR Enable auto-merge. 🚀 All reactions Sorry, something went wrong. Uh oh! There was an error while loading.

  "llm_reason": "The commit updates the version of an external dependency (vllm-flash-attn) by changing the git tag in a non-test file (CMakeLists.txt). The commit message indicates that this update is intended to reduce CPU overheads, meaning it is targeted at performance improvement. Although the change is small (a version update), it is specifically aimed at reducing CPU overheads, which qualifies as a performance optimization. Therefore, the commit meets the conditions specified for being performance-related.",
