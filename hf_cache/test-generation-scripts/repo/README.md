# ISO-Bench Test Generation Scripts

This dataset contains automatically generated performance test scripts for the ISO-Bench project. These scripts are designed to measure and benchmark the performance impact of various optimizations in machine learning inference systems.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Scripts**: 178 Python test generators
- **Categories**: 2 main collections
- **Domain**: Machine Learning Performance Testing
- **Target Systems**: Inference optimization benchmarks

## Directory Structure

### `generated_test_generators_v4/` (82 files)
This directory contains the fourth version of automatically generated test scripts. These are the latest iteration of test generators with improved:
- Performance measurement accuracy
- Hardware detection capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Equivalence checking mechanisms

### `working_test_generators/` (96 files)
This directory contains verified and validated test generators that have been successfully tested in production environments. These scripts include:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Robust mock implementations
- Advanced timing mechanisms
- Multi-environment support

## Script Features

Each test generator script typically includes:

- **Deterministic Setup**: Ensures reproducible results across runs
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically detects GPU/CPU capabilities
- **Target Resolution**: Dynamically imports and tests optimization targets
- **Performance Timing**: High-precision timing with statistical analysis
- **Equivalence Checking**: Validates functional correctness of optimizations
- **Result Storage**: Serializable output for comparative analysis

## Usage

Each script follows a standardized interface:

```python
python script_name.py [--eqcheck] [--reference] [--prefix PREFIX]
```

- `--eqcheck`: Enable equivalence checking against reference results
- `--reference`: Generate reference results for future comparisons
- `--prefix`: Add prefix to output files

## Output Format

Scripts output JSON with performance metrics:

```json
{
  "impl_tag": "child",
  "commit_hash": "abc123...",
  "device": "cuda",
  "dtype": "torch.float16",
  "avg_ms": 1.23,
  "p50_ms": 1.20,
  "p95_ms": 1.45,
  "eq_level": "numeric"
}
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Hardware-specific dependencies (CUDA for GPU tests)
