### OpenHands Local Runtime Run Report (commit 8aa1485f and related tasks)

#### Context
- Goal: Run OpenHands locally (no Docker) within `bench-env` on vLLM optimization tasks, focusing on commit `8aa1485fcff7be3e42300c0615ee0f3f3cbce9a8` and verifying workspace path correctness to avoid agent loops.

#### Environment
- Python: 3.12.11 (from `bench-env`)
- OpenHands: 0.56.0 successfully imported
- Installed system/runtime deps:
  - tmux (system package)
  - Playwright browsers via `python -m playwright install --with-deps`
- Added Python deps to `requirements.txt`:
  - playwright>=1.45.0, pytest-playwright>=0.4.2, libtmux>=0.23.1
- CLI wiring: `PYTHONPATH=/workspace/ISO-Bench/ISO-Bench` for `python -m bench.cli ...`
- Doctor: `bench.cli doctor --bench-cfg ISO-Bench/bench_test.yaml` → OK (Docker not present, not required for local runtime)

#### Critical Fix: Workspace Path Confusion
- Problem: Prompts and headless instructions referenced `/workspace` (container path), causing file lookups like `/workspace/vllm/...` under local runtime.
- Edits in `ISO-Bench/bench/prepare.py`:
  - Use the actual git worktree path (`agent_workspace_root = str(wt_dir)`) inside all user-visible prompts and headless messages.
  - Updated “Immediate action” and completion command sections to use the resolved worktree path.
  - Left container-only flags/mounts intact (they still use `/workspace` when container mode is selected).
- Result: OpenHands logs now consistently show the correct workspace path:
  - “Workspace base path is set to /workspace/ISO-Bench/ISO-Bench/.work/worktrees/..."

#### Runs Executed (bench_test.yaml, no Docker)

1) MoE Align Optimization (`tasks/moe_align_optimization.yaml`)
- Plan: `0ec82edda59... parent=1`
- Prepare: successfully starts in correct worktree.
- Outcome: Agent loop (CodeActAgent analysis cycles), 0 file changes → marked error. Pathing correct; behavior limited.

2) Prefix Caching Optimization (`tasks/prefix_caching_optimization.yaml`)
- Plan: `2deb029d115dadd012ce5ea70487a207cb025493 parent=1`
- Prepare: runs in correct worktree.
- Outcome: Agent loop pattern persists; 0 file changes.

3) Chunked Local Attention (target commit 8aa1485f)
- Task created: `tasks/chunked_local_attn_optimization.yaml`
  - Repo: `vllm`
  - Targets: `vllm/config.py`, `vllm/envs.py`
  - Constraints: maintain functionality; focus on perf
- Plan: `8aa1485fcff7be3e42300c0615ee0f3f3cbce9a8 parent=1` → `state/chunked_plan.json`
- Prepare: local runtime, max iterations=50
- Outcome:
  - Final agent state: FINISHED
  - Files changed: `vllm/config.py`, `vllm/envs.py`, and `test_opt.py`
  - Target enforcement: FAIL (extra `test_opt.py` not in allowed targets)
  - Artifacts written: `prediction.jsonl`, `model_patch.diff`
  - Run dir example: `ISO-Bench/state/runs/chunked_local_attn_opt-<run_id>/<item_id>/`

#### Observations
- Workspace issue resolved: all runs use the correct worktree path; no erroneous `/workspace/vllm/...` lookups in local runtime.
- Agent behavior remains the primary limitation (CodeActAgent tends to loop). In the 8aa task the agent made changes (including the two targeted files) but also created `test_opt.py`, breaching strict target list.

#### Recommendations (short-term)
- Keep the corrected path behavior (worktree absolute path in prompts) for local runtime.
- For strict-target tasks, either:
  - Allow `test_opt.py` explicitly in targets; or
  - Instruct the agent to time inline or in a whitelisted location to avoid enforcement failure.
- If acceptable, test an alternate agent/model with more action bias to reduce loops.

#### Artifacts and References
- Key files touched:
  - `ISO-Bench/bench/prepare.py` (prompt/headless path fixes)
  - `requirements.txt` (added playwright/libtmux deps)
  - `ISO-Bench/tasks/chunked_local_attn_optimization.yaml` (new task for 8aa)
- Example run directories:
  - `ISO-Bench/state/runs/moe_align_opt-.../`
  - `ISO-Bench/state/runs/prefix_caching_opt-.../`
  - `ISO-Bench/state/runs/chunked_local_attn_opt-.../`

#### Summary
- Environment verified and prepared (Python 3.12, OpenHands 0.56.0, tmux, Playwright).
- Fixed local-runtime path issues; agent now operates in the correct worktree directory.
- On 8aa commit, agent completed with edits to the two targeted files plus an extra file; enforcement failed only due to `test_opt.py` being outside allowed targets.
- On other tasks, agent loops persisted—indicative of agent behavior rather than infrastructure.
