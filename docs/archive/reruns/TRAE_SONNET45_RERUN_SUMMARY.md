# TRAE Sonnet 4.5 Rerun Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Status:** Ready to Execute

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the setup for rerunning unsuccessful TRAE + Claude Sonnet 4.5 commits from the evaluation analysis.

## Background

From the evaluation analysis in `ISO-Bench/eval_results_v2/`:

- **Total TRAE + Sonnet 4.5 runs:** 261 commits
- **Successful runs:** 149 (57%)
- **Unsuccessful runs:** 112 (43%)

### Key Finding: TRAE Bug Was Fixed

According to `eval_results_v2/TOOL_RESULTS_BUG_FIX_VERIFICATION.md`, the critical `tool_results` bug that caused **51% of all TRAE failures** (272 runs) has been **successfully fixed and verified**.

This bug was responsible for three types of API errors:
1. `TOOL_OUTPUT_MISSING` (OpenAI): 142 failures
2. `TOOL_RESULT_MISSING` (Anthropic): 74 failures
3. `EMPTY_ERROR_CONTENT` (Anthropic): 56 failures

With this fix, **we expect many previously failed commits to now succeed**.

## Extracted Unsuccessful Commits

### Total: 142 unique unsuccessful commits

#### By Repository
- **vLLM:** 91 commits
- **SGLang:** 51 commits

#### By Failure Reason
| Reason | Count | Notes |
|--------|------:|-------|
| AGENT_NO_PATCH | 73 | Agent failed to produce patch (many due to fixed bug) |
| TEST_IMPORT_ERROR | 31 | Missing Python modules in test environment |
| TARGET_NOT_RESOLVED | 15 | Cannot import optimization target |
| BASELINE_TYPE_ERROR | 13 | API signature mismatch in test |
| BASELINE_EXCEPTION | 11 | Other exceptions in test |
| BASELINE_IMPORT_ERROR | 9 | Missing modules for baseline |
| NO_TEST_SCRIPT | 6 | No test script available |
| PATCH_INVALID | 4 | Patch marked as invalid |
| SUCCESS_REGRESSION | 4 | Optimization made things worse |
| Other | 8 | Various other issues |

## Rerun Setup

### Files Created

1. **Commit Lists**
   - `ISO-Bench/TRAE_SONNET45_VLLM_UNSUCCESSFUL.txt` (91 commits)
   - `ISO-Bench/TRAE_SONNET45_SGLANG_UNSUCCESSFUL.txt` (51 commits)
   - `ISO-Bench/TRAE_SONNET45_ALL_UNSUCCESSFUL.txt` (142 commits)

2. **Rerun Plans** (JSON format for bench.cli)
   - `ISO-Bench/state/plan_trae_sonnet45_vllm_rerun.json` (91 commits)
   - `ISO-Bench/state/plan_trae_sonnet45_sglang_rerun.json` (51 commits)

3. **Execution Scripts**
   - `rerun_trae_sonnet45_vllm.sh` - Run vLLM rerun only
   - `rerun_trae_sonnet45_sglang.sh` - Run SGLang rerun only
   - `rerun_trae_sonnet45_all.sh` - Run both sequentially

---

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run vLLM Rerun Only (91 commits)

```bash
./rerun_trae_sonnet45_vllm.sh
```

**Expected duration:** ~15-20 hours (at ~10-15 min/commit)

### Option 2: Run SGLang Rerun Only (51 commits)

```bash
./rerun_trae_sonnet45_sglang.sh
```

**Expected duration:** ~8-10 hours (at ~10-15 min/commit)

### Option 3: Run Complete Rerun (142 commits)

```bash
./rerun_trae_sonnet45_all.sh
```

**Expected duration:** ~24-30 hours total

### Manual Invocation

If you prefer to run manually:

```bash
cd ISO-Bench

# vLLM rerun
.venv/bin/python -m bench.cli prepare tasks/vllm.yaml \
  --from-plan state/plan_trae_sonnet45_vllm_rerun.json \
  --bench-cfg bench.yaml \
  --max-workers 1 \
  --resume

# SGLang rerun
.venv/bin/python -m bench.cli prepare tasks/sglang.yaml \
  --from-plan state/plan_trae_sonnet45_sglang_rerun.json \
  --bench-cfg bench.yaml \
  --max-workers 1 \
  --resume
```

## What to Expect

### Expected Improvements

With the `tool_results` bug fix, we expect:

1. **Significant reduction in AGENT_NO_PATCH failures**
   - Previously: 73 commits failed due to this
   - Expected: Most of these should now succeed

2. **Higher success rate overall**
   - Previously: 57% success rate (149/261)
   - Expected: 75-85% success rate after rerun

### Known Limitations

Some failures will persist due to environmental issues:
- **TEST_IMPORT_ERROR** (31 commits): Missing Python modules
- **TARGET_NOT_RESOLVED** (15 commits): API changes between versions
- **BASELINE_TYPE_ERROR** (13 commits): API signature mismatches

These require fixing the test environment, not the agent.

---

## Monitoring Progress

### View Results

```bash
cd ISO-Bench

# Find latest run
LATEST=$(ls -t state/runs | head -n1)

# Generate report
.venv/bin/python -m bench.cli report state/runs/$LATEST
```

### Check Individual Run

```bash
cd ISO-Bench

# View journal for a specific commit
cat state/runs/<run_id>/<item_id>/journal.json

# View trajectory (LLM interactions)
cat state/runs/<run_id>/<item_id>/trajectory.json

# View patch (if generated)
cat state/runs/<run_id>/<item_id>/model_patch.diff
```

## Cost Estimation

### API Costs

Based on previous runs with TRAE + Sonnet 4.5:

- **Average tokens per commit:** ~180K tokens
- **Total tokens for 142 commits:** ~25M tokens
- **Estimated cost:** $75-125 (depending on AWS Bedrock pricing)

### Compute Costs

- **EC2 instance:** g5.2xlarge or similar
- **Duration:** ~24-30 hours for complete rerun
- **Estimated cost:** $30-50 (depending on instance type and region)

**Total estimated cost:** $105-175 for complete rerun

---

## Next Steps After Rerun

1. **Compare results with original run**
   - How many previously failed commits now succeed?
   - What's the new success rate?

2. **Analyze remaining failures**
   - Which failure categories persist?
   - What needs to be fixed in the test environment?

3. **Update evaluation analysis**
   - Regenerate `EVALUATION_ANALYSIS.md`
   - Update success rate metrics

4. **Consider additional reruns**
   - Run other agent/model combinations on these commits
   - Compare TRAE performance with Codex

## Troubleshooting

### If AWS credentials expire
```bash
# Refresh AWS SSO credentials
aws sso login --profile your-profile
```

### If run gets interrupted
The scripts use `--resume` flag, so you can simply restart:
```bash
./rerun_trae_sonnet45_vllm.sh  # Will resume from where it left off
```

### If you want to skip certain commits
Edit the plan JSON file and remove the entries you want to skip, then restart the run.
