│ Basic guidelines:                                                                                                                                                │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_019_31589e17 directory │
│ to improve the performance of the <test_script>.                                                                                                                 │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.                                                                        │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.                        │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.         │
│                                                                                                                                                                  │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                                                                                                       │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                                                                                                            │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_019_31589e17/.bench_scratch (e.g.,               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_019_31589e17/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example,     │
│ then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                                                                                                    │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.                                                                                                │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.                                                                                       │
│                                                                                                                                                                  │

│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_019_31589e17 directory │
│ to improve the performance of the <test_script>.                                                                                                                 │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.                                                                        │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.                        │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.         │
│                                                                                                                                                                  │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                                                                                                       │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                                                                                                            │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_019_31589e17/.bench_scratch (e.g.,               │

│ then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                                                                                                    │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.                                                                                                │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.                                                                                       │
│                                                                                                                                                                  │
