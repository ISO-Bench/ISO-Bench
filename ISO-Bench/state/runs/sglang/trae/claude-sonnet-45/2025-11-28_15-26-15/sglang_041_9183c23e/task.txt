I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e.
Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the repository:

<test_script>
# This is a performance optimization task
# The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below
# Focus on performance improvements in the target functions

</test_script>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?

Basic guidelines:
1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.
2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.
3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.
4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.

Follow these steps to improve performance:
1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.
2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.
3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.
4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.

Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to improve performance in this codebase:

IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were successful in a different context.
These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.
Your task is to:
1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros → torch.empty)
2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files
3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations
4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor

The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have these optimizations yet.
You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.

HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization
2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate
3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary
4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code

START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:
```bash
grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_' vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py
```

CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:
- Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks
- Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations
- Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures

Target files to optimize:
- python/sglang/srt/managers/io_struct.py
- python/sglang/srt/managers/tp_worker.py
- python/sglang/srt/model_executor/model_runner.py

IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.
The task will fail if no files are modified.

## Constraints
- No public API breakage
- All TestPack checks must pass

## Target Files (ONLY modify these)
- `python/sglang/srt/managers/io_struct.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/managers/tp_worker.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/model_executor/model_runner.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/server.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/utils.py`
- `test/srt/test_update_weights_from_tensor.py`

## SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
Based on the human commit analysis, focus on these areas:
- Memory allocation patterns (torch.zeros vs torch.empty)
- Tensor initialization strategies
- Kernel parameter optimization
- Buffer reuse and caching

### Human Developer's Approach:
```
Speed up `update_weights_from_tensor` (#2695)
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Start editing files by iteration 3
2. Create and run /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py before and after edits (do not create timing scripts outside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e/.bench_scratch)
3. Make at least 3 concrete optimizations
4. Commit changes by iteration 8
5. Use finish command by iteration 10

## TASK COMPLETION COMMAND:
When you have made optimizations:
```bash
git add -A
git reset -q .bench_scratch || true
git commit -m 'Optimize MoE align sum kernels performance'
git diff $(git merge-base HEAD origin/HEAD || git rev-parse HEAD~1) -- . ':(exclude).bench_scratch' > /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sglang_041_9183c23e/model_patch.diff || true
finish
```

START IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY. NO MORE ANALYSIS.
