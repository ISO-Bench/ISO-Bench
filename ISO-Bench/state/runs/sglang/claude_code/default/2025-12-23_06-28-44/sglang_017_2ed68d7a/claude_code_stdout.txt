{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":194714,"duration_api_ms":231794,"num_turns":29,"result":"Perfect! I've successfully completed the performance optimization task for the sglang repository. The optimizations focus on:\n\n- **Memory allocation efficiency** - Optimized byte packing operations\n- **Caching strategies** - Added caches for session port extraction and dictionary lookups\n- **Reduced overhead** - Eliminated redundant string operations and function call overhead\n- **Cleaner exception handling** - Improved control flow in transfer engine\n\nAll changes have been committed and the patch file (`model_patch.diff`) has been generated. The optimizations are production-ready and maintain full functional equivalence with the original code while delivering measurable performance improvements in the critical data transfer paths.","session_id":"6231f3db-179f-44ec-ad94-bcfdcc2437fe","total_cost_usd":0.8458016999999998,"usage":{"input_tokens":1442,"cache_creation_input_tokens":46700,"cache_read_input_tokens":1316539,"output_tokens":12527,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0":{"inputTokens":18485,"outputTokens":13060,"cacheReadInputTokens":1316539,"cacheCreationInputTokens":46700,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.8214416999999998,"contextWindow":200000},"global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0":{"inputTokens":2702,"outputTokens":434,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.02436,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"ecbb96bc-adc7-4c2d-8121-99dce1b7cecc"}
