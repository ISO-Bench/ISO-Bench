Plan: I scanned the repo for zero-inits and fill_ calls in the target areas, added a quick local benchmark to time a common path (prompt tensor preparation), then replaced several torch.zeros allocations with torch.empty where buffers are immediately overwritten. I reran the benchmark to validate runtime improvement.
