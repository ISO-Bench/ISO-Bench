I created a small benchmark, took a baseline (CUDA not available here), then made targeted performance optimizations across the allowed files. The changes reduce unnecessary allocations/initializations, cut dtype conversions, and prepare faster MoE backends via env flags. You can re-run the timing script on your GPU box to validate improvements.
