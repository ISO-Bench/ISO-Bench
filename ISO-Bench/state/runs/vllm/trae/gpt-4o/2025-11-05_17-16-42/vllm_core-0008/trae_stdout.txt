│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                                                                                       │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0008 directory to improve the performance of the             │
│ <test_script>.                                                                                                                                 │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.                                                      │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.      │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with     │
│ running them.                                                                                                                                  │

│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                                                                                     │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                                                                                          │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0008/.bench_scratch (e.g.,    │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0008/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the   │
│ example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                                                                         │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.                                                                              │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.                                                                     │
│                                                                                                                                                │
