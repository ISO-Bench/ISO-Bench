│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 009 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure and understand the      │
│ target files.                                                                │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 009/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                                                    │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 009/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then      │
│ execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                     │
│ 3. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks in the target files.         │
│ 4. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 5. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Common optimization strategies to consider:                                  │
│ - Reduce unnecessary memory allocations                                      │
│ - Avoid redundant computations                                               │
│ - Optimize data structures and algorithms                                    │
│ - Improve cache locality                                                     │
│ - Reduce synchronization overhead                                            │
│ - Use more efficient library calls where available                           │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - vllm/core/block_manager_v1.py                                              │
│ - vllm/sequence.py                                                           │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 009 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure and understand the      │
│ target files.                                                                │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 009/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                                                    │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 009/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then      │
│ execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                     │
│ 3. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks in the target files.         │
│ 4. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 5. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Common optimization strategies to consider:                                  │
│ - Reduce unnecessary memory allocations                                      │
│ - Avoid redundant computations                                               │
│ - Optimize data structures and algorithms                                    │
│ - Improve cache locality                                                     │
│ - Reduce synchronization overhead                                            │
│ - Use more efficient library calls where available                           │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - vllm/core/block_manager_v1.py                                              │
│ - vllm/sequence.py                                                           │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│             │ │ block_table.computed = True\n```\n\nThe loop   │
│             │ │ iterates in reverse from max_full_block-1 down │
│             │ │ to 0. The issue is:\n1. It calls               │
│             │ │ `seq.get_len()` which computes length each     │
│             │ │ time\n2. The loop uses                         │
│             │ │ `reversed(range(max_full_block))` which        │
│             │ │ creates an iterator\n\nFor optimization:\n1.   │
│             │ │ Cache the length in SequenceData to avoid      │
│             │ │ recomputing it\n2. The reversed iteration      │
│             │ │ could be optimized to iterate directly without │
│             │ │ creating range\n\nLet me check the statistics: │
│             │ │ "2 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 2           │
│             │ │ deletions(-)"\n- sequence.py: 3 insertions     │
│             │ │ (likely caching length)\n-                     │
│             │ │ block_manager_v1.py: 2 insertions, 2 deletions │
│             │ │ (likely optimizing the loop)\n\nThe key        │
│             │ │ insight: `get_len()` is called frequently and  │
│             │ │ each call does `len(self._output_token_ids) +  │
│             │ │ len(self._prompt_token_ids)`. While len() is   │
│             │ │ O(1) for arrays, calling it twice and adding   │
│             │ │ them repeatedly is wasteful.\n\nSolution:\n1.  │
│             │ │ Cache the total length in SequenceData\n2.     │
│             │ │ Update the cache when tokens are appended\n3.  │
