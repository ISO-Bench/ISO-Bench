│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 001 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure and understand the      │
│ target files.                                                                │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 001/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                                                    │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 001/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then      │
│ execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                     │
│ 3. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks in the target files.         │
│ 4. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 5. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Common optimization strategies to consider:                                  │
│ - Reduce unnecessary memory allocations                                      │
│ - Avoid redundant computations                                               │
│ - Optimize data structures and algorithms                                    │
│ - Improve cache locality                                                     │
│ - Reduce synchronization overhead                                            │
│ - Use more efficient library calls where available                           │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - tests/core/block/test_block_manager_v2.py                                  │
│ - tests/core/block/test_cpu_gpu_block_allocator.py                           │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 001 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure and understand the      │
│ target files.                                                                │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 001/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                                                    │
│ /root/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0 │
│ 001/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then      │
│ execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.                     │
│ 3. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks in the target files.         │
│ 4. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 5. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Common optimization strategies to consider:                                  │
│ - Reduce unnecessary memory allocations                                      │
│ - Avoid redundant computations                                               │
│ - Optimize data structures and algorithms                                    │
│ - Improve cache locality                                                     │
│ - Reduce synchronization overhead                                            │
│ - Use more efficient library calls where available                           │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - tests/core/block/test_block_manager_v2.py                                  │
│ - tests/core/block/test_cpu_gpu_block_allocator.py                           │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
