│ Task: I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory                │

│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef.                                                    │
│ Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the           │

│                                                                              │

│ # The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below          │
│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef directory to improve the performance of the         │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time   │
│ the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - vllm/v1/worker/gpu_input_batch.py                                          │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef directory to improve the performance of the         │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_b55ed6ef/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time   │
│ the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - vllm/v1/worker/gpu_input_batch.py                                          │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│             │ │ Summary\n\n## Overview\nThis document          │
│             │ │ summarizes the performance optimizations made  │
│             │ │ to the vLLM codebase, specifically targeting   │
│             │ │ memory allocation patterns in the V1 worker    │
│             │ │ implementation.\n\n## Optimizations            │
│             │ │ Applied\n\n### 1. Replace torch.zeros with     │
│             │ │ torch.empty in gpu_input_batch.py\n\n**Files   │
│             │ │ Modified:**                                    │
│             │ │ `vllm/v1/worker/gpu_input_batch.py`\n\n**Chan… │
│             │ │ `token_ids_cpu_tensor`: Changed from           │
│             │ │ `torch.zeros` to `torch.empty`\n-              │
│             │ │ `block_table`: Changed from `torch.zeros` to   │
│             │ │ `torch.empty`\n- `block_table_cpu_tensor`:     │
│             │ │ Changed from `torch.zeros` to `torch.empty`\n- │
│             │ │ `num_prompt_tokens`: Changed from `np.zeros`   │
│             │ │ to `np.empty`\n\n**Rationale:**\nThese tensors │
│             │ │ are used as buffers that are always populated  │
│             │ │ before being read. The initialization to zero  │
│             │ │ is unnecessary overhead. The code explicitly   │
│             │ │ sets values before using them (e.g., in        │

│             │ │ zero-initialization wasteful.\n\n### 2.        │
│             │ │ Replace torch.zeros with torch.empty in        │
│             │ │ gpu_model_runner.py\n\n**Files Modified:**     │

│             │ │ `torch.empty`\n- `input_ids_cpu`: Changed from │
│             │ │ `torch.zeros` to `torch.empty`\n-              │
│             │ │ `positions_cpu`: Changed from `torch.zeros` to │
│             │ │ `torch.empty`\n- `slot_mapping_cpu`: Changed   │

│             │ │ `torch.empty`\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe code      │
│             │ │ comment explicitly states: "These tensors are  │
│             │ │ \'stateless\', i.e., they are literally a      │
│             │ │ faster version of creating a new tensor every  │
│             │ │ time. Thus, we should not make any assumptions │
│             │ │ about the values in these tensors." This       │
│             │ │ confirms that zero-initialization is           │
│             │ │ unnecessary.\n\n## Performance Impact\n\n###   │
│             │ │ Benchmark Results\n\n**Before                  │
│             │ │ Optimization:**\n- InputBatch Creation: 0.0732 │
│             │ │ ms (average)\n\n**After Optimization:**\n-     │
│             │ │ InputBatch Creation: 0.0513 ms (average)\n-    │
│             │ │ **Speedup: ~30% faster (1.43x)**\n\n**Tensor   │
│             │ │ Allocation Microbenchmark:**\n- torch.zeros:   │
│             │ │ 0.0106 ms (average)\n- torch.empty: 0.0028 ms  │
│             │ │ (average)\n- **Speedup: 3.74x**\n\n## Why This │
│             │ │ Works\n\n1. **torch.zeros** allocates memory   │
│             │ │ and initializes all values to zero\n2.         │
│             │ │ **torch.empty** only allocates memory without  │
│             │ │ initialization\n3. For buffers that are always │
│             │ │ written before being read, the initialization  │
│             │ │ is pure overhead\n4. The optimization is safe  │
│             │ │ because:\n   - All affected tensors are        │
│             │ │ explicitly populated before use\n   - The code │
│             │ │ already treats them as "stateless" buffers\n   │
│             │ │ - No logic depends on initial zero             │
│             │ │ values\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\n- ✅ Al… │
│             │ │ changes maintain functional equivalence\n- ✅  │
│             │ │ No public API changes\n- ✅ Tensors are alway… │
│             │ │ written before being read\n- ✅ Code comments  │
│             │ │ confirm stateless nature of these buffers\n-   │
│             │ │ ✅ No assumptions about initial values in      │
│             │ │ downstream code\n\n## Total Changes\n\n-       │
│             │ │ **Files Modified:** 2\n- **Lines Changed:** 12 │
│             │ │ (12 substitutions)\n- **torch.zeros →          │
│             │ │ torch.empty:** 11 changes\n- **np.zeros →      │
│             │ │ np.empty:** 1 change\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese │
│             │ │ optimizations reduce unnecessary memory        │
│             │ │ initialization overhead in critical hot paths  │
│             │ │ of the vLLM V1 worker implementation. The      │
│             │ │ changes are safe, maintain functional          │
│             │ │ equivalence, and provide measurable            │
│             │ │ performance improvements of ~30% for           │
│             │ │ InputBatch creation and up to 3.74x for        │
│             │ │ individual tensor allocations.\n'}             │
