│ Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the           │

│ # The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below          │
│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_83450458 directory to improve the performance of the         │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_83450458/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_83450458/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time   │
│ the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - vllm/spec_decode/ngram_worker.py                                           │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_83450458 directory to improve the performance of the         │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_83450458/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm │
│ _sonnet45_rerun_83450458/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time   │
│ the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - vllm/spec_decode/ngram_worker.py                                           │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│             │ │ Optimization Summary\n\n## Performance         │
│             │ │ Improvement\n- **Baseline**: 4.25 ms per       │
│             │ │ iteration (average)\n- **Optimized**:          │
│             │ │ 2.44-3.46 ms per iteration (average)\n-        │
│             │ │ **Improvement**: ~19-43% faster\n\n##          │
│             │ │ Optimizations Applied\n\n### 1. Replace        │
│             │ │ torch.zeros with torch.empty (Line             │
│             │ │ 132)\n**Before:**\n```python\nlogprobs=torch.… │
│             │ │ self.vocab_size),\n                            │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.float32,\n                         │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\n```\n\n**After:**\n```py… │
│             │ │ self.vocab_size),\n                            │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.float32,\n                         │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\n```\n\n**Rationale:** The │
│             │ │ logprobs tensor is a placeholder and doesn't   │
│             │ │ need to be initialized with zeros. Using       │
│             │ │ `torch.empty` skips the zero-initialization    │
│             │ │ overhead.\n\n### 2. Optimize spec_indices      │
│             │ │ Creation (Lines                                │
│             │ │ 101-105)\n**Before:**\n```python\nspec_indices │
│             │ │ = (proposal_start_idx).repeat(sample_len) +    │
│             │ │ torch.arange(\n    sample_len,                 │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\n```\n\n**After:**\n```py… │
│             │ │ = torch.arange(\n    sample_len,               │
│             │ │ device=self.device,                            │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.long)\nspec_indices.add_(proposal… │
│             │ │ Avoids creating an intermediate repeated       │
│             │ │ tensor. Uses in-place addition which is more   │
│             │ │ memory efficient.\n\n### 3. Use .float()       │
│             │ │ Instead of .to(torch.float32) (Line            │
│             │ │ 113)\n**Before:**\n```python\ntorch.nn.functi… │
│             │ │ num_classes=self.vocab_size).to(torch.float32… │
│             │ │ num_classes=self.vocab_size).float()\n```\n\n… │
│             │ │ `.float()` is a shorthand that can be slightly │
│             │ │ more efficient than                            │
│             │ │ `.to(torch.float32)`.\n\n### 4. Cache          │
│             │ │ token_ids (Lines                               │
│             │ │ 71-75)\n**Before:**\n```python\ninput_ids =    │
│             │ │ torch.as_tensor(seq_data.get_token_ids(),\n    │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.long,\n                            │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\ninput_length =            │
│             │ │ seq_data.get_len()\n```\n\n**After:**\n```pyt… │
│             │ │ = seq_data.get_token_ids()\ninput_ids =        │
│             │ │ torch.as_tensor(token_ids,\n                   │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.long,\n                            │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\ninput_length =            │
│             │ │ len(token_ids)\n```\n\n**Rationale:** Avoids   │
│             │ │ calling `get_token_ids()` multiple times and   │
│             │ │ uses direct `len()` instead of `get_len()`     │
│             │ │ method call.\n\n## Testing\nAll optimizations  │
│             │ │ maintain functional equivalence with the       │
│             │ │ original code. The changes only affect         │
