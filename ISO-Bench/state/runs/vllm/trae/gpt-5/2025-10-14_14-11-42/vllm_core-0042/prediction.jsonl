These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n+There are three methods for KVCache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC.

Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n+To address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVCache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules.
