Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.\n2.

Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.\n4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.\n\nFollow these steps to improve performance:\n1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.\n2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.\n3.

These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n+There are three methods for KVCache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC.

Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly, including reasonable, directly implied follow-up actions.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., <class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'> or <class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'>' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>', '<class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>', and '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>', <class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>, '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>', <class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>, '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'>' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n7. **END:** If the user is satisfied, mark the task as complete using the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n- **FINISH:** When the user requirements are satisfied and no further todos remain, use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool to mark the task as complete.\n\n## Task Completion and Clarification\n\nUse the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool in these scenarios:\n\n**For Task Completion:**\n- Successfully completed all requested work\n- Provide summary of what was accomplished\n- Include any next steps or recommendations\n- Example: \"Successfully implemented user authentication with JWT tokens. Added login/logout endpoints and protected routes. Tests are passing. Next steps: Review the implementation and deploy to staging environment.\"\n\n**For Clarification Requests:**\n- Missing critical information to proceed\n- Ambiguous requirements need clarification\n- Technical limitations prevent completion\n- User input required for next steps\n- Example: \"I need clarification on the database schema. Should I create a new 'users' table or modify the existing 'accounts' table? Also, what fields are required for user profiles?\"\n\n**For Blocking Issues:**\n- Cannot proceed due to missing dependencies, permissions, or environment issues\n- Need user intervention to resolve technical problems\n- Example: \"Cannot proceed: The project requires Python 3.9+ but the current environment has Python 3.7. Please upgrade Python or provide guidance on how to proceed with the current version.\"\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>' or '<class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'>' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n- **FINISH:** When the user requirements are satisfied and no further todos remain, use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool to mark the task as complete.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel:\n<tool_call>\n<function=bash>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n<parameter=restart>\nfalse\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=str_replace_based_edit_tool>\n<parameter=command>\nview\n</parameter>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=str_replace_based_edit_tool>\n<parameter=command>\nview\n</parameter>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/src/auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved."

Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.\n2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.\n3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.\n4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.\n\nFollow these steps to improve performance:\n1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.\n2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.\n3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.\n4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.\n\nHere is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to improve performance in this codebase:\n\n<example_optimization_diff>\ndiff --git a/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md b/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md\nindex b1df93cfc..8f6a2b3b2 100644\n--- a/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md\n+++ b/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md\n@@ -31,7 +31,7 @@ Each P/D instance periodically sends a heartbeat packet to the Proxy/Router (cur\n \n ## KV Cache Transfer Methods\n \n-There are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill.

Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2.

The client sends an HTTP request to the Proxy/Router's `/v1/completions` interface.  \n     9\t2. The Proxy/Router selects a **1P1D (1 Prefill instance + 1 Decode instance)** through either through round-robin or random selection, generates a `request_id` (rules to be introduced later), modifies the `max_tokens` in the HTTP request message to **1**, and then forwards the request to the **P instance**.  \n    10\t3. Immediately afterward, the Proxy/Router forwards the **original HTTP request** to the **D instance**.  \n    11\t4. The **P instance** performs **Prefill** and then **actively sends the generated KV cache** to the D instance (using **PUT_ASYNC** mode). The D instance's `zmq_addr` can be resolved through the `request_id`.  \n    12\t5. The **D instance** has a **dedicated thread** for receiving the KV cache (to avoid blocking the main process). The received KV cache is saved into the **GPU memory buffer**, the size of which is determined by the vLLM startup parameter `kv_buffer_size`. When the GPU buffer is full, the KV cache is stored in the **local Tensor memory pool**.  \n    13\t6. During the **Decode**, the D instance's main process retrieves the KV cache (transmitted by the P instance) from either the **GPU buffer** or the **memory pool**, thereby **skipping Prefill**.  \n    14\t7. After completing **Decode**, the D instance returns the result to the **Proxy/Router**, which then forwards it to the **client**.\n    15\t\n    16\t![image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb01bde6-755b-49f7-ad45-48a94b1e10a7)\n    17\t\n    18\t## Proxy/Router (Demo)\n    19\t\n    20\tA simple HTTP service acts as the entry point for client requests and starts a background thread to listen for P/D instances reporting their HTTP IP and PORT, as well as ZMQ IP and PORT. It maintains a dictionary of `http_addr -> zmq_addr`. The `http_addr` is the IP:PORT for the vLLM instance's request, while the `zmq_addr` is the address for KV cache handshake and metadata reception.\n    21\t\n    22\tThe Proxy/Router is responsible for selecting 1P1D based on the characteristics of the client request, such as the prompt, and generating a corresponding `request_id`, for example:\n    23\t\n    24\t```\n    25\tcmpl-___prefill_addr_10.0.1.2:21001___decode_addr_10.0.1.3:22001_93923d63113b4b338973f24d19d4bf11-0\n    26\t```\n    27\t\n    28\tCurrently, to quickly verify whether xPyD can work, a round-robin selection of 1P1D is used. In the future, it is planned to use a trie combined with the load status of instances to select appropriate P and D.\n    29\t\n    30\tEach P/D instance periodically sends a heartbeat packet to the Proxy/Router (currently every 3 seconds) to register (i.e., report `http_addr -> zmq_addr`) and keep the connection alive. If an instance crashes and fails to send a ping for a certain period of time, the Proxy/Router will remove the timed-out instance (this feature has not yet been developed).\n    31\t\n    32\t## KV Cache Transfer Methods\n    33\t\n    34\tThere are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n    35\t\n    36\tExperimental results have shown that the performance of these methods, from highest to lowest, is as follows: PUT_ASYNC → GET → PUT.\n    37\t\n    38\t## P2P Communication via ZMQ & NCCL\n    39\t\n    40\tAs long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.\n    41\t\n    42\tEach P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.\n    43\t\n    44\tWhen a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVcache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.\n    45\t\n    46\t## NCCL Group Topology\n    47\t\n    48\tCurrently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n    49\t\n    50\t![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/837e61d6-365e-4cbf-8640-6dd7ab295b36)\n    51\t\n    52\tEach NCCL group occupies a certain amount of GPU memory buffer for communication, the size of which is primarily influenced by the `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` environment variable. When `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=16`, an NCCL group typically occupies 100MB, while when `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=8`, it usually takes up 52MB. For large-scale xPyD configurations—such as DeepSeek's 96P144D—this implementation is currently not feasible. Moving forward, we are considering using RDMA for point-to-point communication and are also keeping an eye on UCCL.\n    53\t\n    54\t## GPU Memory Buffer and Tensor Memory Pool\n    55\t\n    56\tThe trade-off in the size of the memory buffer is as follows: For P instances, the memory buffer is not required in PUT and PUT_ASYNC modes, but it is necessary in GET mode. For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVcache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVcache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n    57\t\n    58\tIf the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVcache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n    59\t\n    60\tTo address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n    61\t\n    62\t# Install vLLM\n    63\t\n    64\t??? console \"Commands\"\n    65\t\n    66\t    ```shell\n    67\t    # Enter the home directory or your working directory.\n    68\t    cd /home\n    69\t\n    70\t    # Download the installation package, and I will update the commit-id in time.

The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the kvcache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received kvcache will overflow, causing the kvcache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the kvcache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n    89\t- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive kvcache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the kvcache sent to the D instance.\n    90\t- You may need to modify the `kv_buffer_size` and `port` in the following commands (if there is a conflict).\n    91\t- `PUT_ASYNC` offers the best performance and should be prioritized.\n    92\t- The `--port` must be consistent with the `http_port` in the `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    93\t- The `disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py` script will use port 10001 (for receiving client requests) and port 30001 (for receiving service discovery from P and D instances).\n    94\t- The node running the proxy must have `quart` installed.\n    95\t- Supports multiple nodes; you just need to modify the `proxy_ip` and `proxy_port` in `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    96\t- In the following examples, it is assumed that **the proxy's IP is 10.0.1.1**.\n    97\t\n    98\t## Run 1P3D\n    99\t\n   100\t### Proxy (e.g. 10.0.1.1)\n   101\t\n   102\t```shell\n   103\tcd {your vllm directory}/examples/online_serving/disagg_xpyd/\n   104\tpython3 disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py &\n   105\t```\n   106\t\n   107\t### Prefill1 (e.g. 10.0.1.2 or 10.0.1.1)\n   108\t\n   109\t???

            "result": "11:4. The **P instance** performs **Prefill** and then **actively sends the generated KV cache** to the D instance (using **PUT_ASYNC** mode). The D instance's `zmq_addr` can be resolved through the `request_id`.  \n12:5. The **D instance** has a **dedicated thread** for receiving the KV cache (to avoid blocking the main process). The received KV cache is saved into the **GPU memory buffer**, the size of which is determined by the vLLM startup parameter `kv_buffer_size`. When the GPU buffer is full, the KV cache is stored in the **local Tensor memory pool**.  \n13:6. During the **Decode**, the D instance's main process retrieves the KV cache (transmitted by the P instance) from either the **GPU buffer** or the **memory pool**, thereby **skipping Prefill**.  \n20:A simple HTTP service acts as the entry point for client requests and starts a background thread to listen for P/D instances reporting their HTTP IP and PORT, as well as ZMQ IP and PORT. It maintains a dictionary of `http_addr -> zmq_addr`. The `http_addr` is the IP:PORT for the vLLM instance's request, while the `zmq_addr` is the address for KV cache handshake and metadata reception.\n34:There are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n40:As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.\n42:Each P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.\n44:When a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVcache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.\n48:Currently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n56:The trade-off in the size of the memory buffer is as follows: For P instances, the memory buffer is not required in PUT and PUT_ASYNC modes, but it is necessary in GET mode. For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVcache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVcache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n58:If the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVcache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n60:To address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n88:- Pay attention to the setting of the `kv_buffer_size` (in bytes). The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the kvcache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received kvcache will overflow, causing the kvcache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the kvcache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n89:- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive kvcache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the kvcache sent to the D instance.",

For subsequent KVCache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVCache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.\n    45\t\n    46\t## NCCL Group Topology\n    47\t\n    48\tCurrently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVCache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n    49\t\n    50\t![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/837e61d6-365e-4cbf-8640-6dd7ab295b36)\n    51\t\n    52\tEach NCCL group occupies a certain amount of GPU memory buffer for communication, the size of which is primarily influenced by the `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` environment variable. When `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=16`, an NCCL group typically occupies 100MB, while when `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=8`, it usually takes up 52MB. For large-scale xPyD configurations—such as DeepSeek's 96P144D—this implementation is currently not feasible.

For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVCache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVCache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n    57\t\n    58\tIf the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVCache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVCache loss. Once KVCache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n    59\t\n    60\tTo address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVCache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVCache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVCache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n    61\t\n    62\t# Install vLLM\n    63\t\n    64\t??? console \"Commands\"\nReview the changes and make sure they are as expected.

The client sends an HTTP request to the Proxy/Router's `/v1/completions` interface.  \n     9\t2. The Proxy/Router selects a **1P1D (1 Prefill instance + 1 Decode instance)** through either through round-robin or random selection, generates a `request_id` (rules to be introduced later), modifies the `max_tokens` in the HTTP request message to **1**, and then forwards the request to the **P instance**.  \n    10\t3. Immediately afterward, the Proxy/Router forwards the **original HTTP request** to the **D instance**.  \n    11\t4. The **P instance** performs **Prefill** and then **actively sends the generated KV cache** to the D instance (using **PUT_ASYNC** mode). The D instance's `zmq_addr` can be resolved through the `request_id`.  \n    12\t5. The **D instance** has a **dedicated thread** for receiving the KV cache (to avoid blocking the main process). The received KV cache is saved into the **GPU memory buffer**, the size of which is determined by the vLLM startup parameter `kv_buffer_size`. When the GPU buffer is full, the KV cache is stored in the **local Tensor memory pool**.  \n    13\t6. During the **Decode**, the D instance's main process retrieves the KV cache (transmitted by the P instance) from either the **GPU buffer** or the **memory pool**, thereby **skipping Prefill**.  \n    14\t7. After completing **Decode**, the D instance returns the result to the **Proxy/Router**, which then forwards it to the **client**.\n    15\t\n    16\t![image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb01bde6-755b-49f7-ad45-48a94b1e10a7)\n    17\t\n    18\t## Proxy/Router (Demo)\n    19\t\n    20\tA simple HTTP service acts as the entry point for client requests and starts a background thread to listen for P/D instances reporting their HTTP IP and PORT, as well as ZMQ IP and PORT. It maintains a dictionary of `http_addr -> zmq_addr`. The `http_addr` is the IP:PORT for the vLLM instance's request, while the `zmq_addr` is the address for KV cache handshake and metadata reception.\n    21\t\n    22\tThe Proxy/Router is responsible for selecting 1P1D based on the characteristics of the client request, such as the prompt, and generating a corresponding `request_id`, for example:\n    23\t\n    24\t```\n    25\tcmpl-___prefill_addr_10.0.1.2:21001___decode_addr_10.0.1.3:22001_93923d63113b4b338973f24d19d4bf11-0\n    26\t```\n    27\t\n    28\tCurrently, to quickly verify whether xPyD can work, a round-robin selection of 1P1D is used. In the future, it is planned to use a trie combined with the load status of instances to select appropriate P and D.\n    29\t\n    30\tEach P/D instance periodically sends a heartbeat packet to the Proxy/Router (currently every 3 seconds) to register (i.e., report `http_addr -> zmq_addr`) and keep the connection alive. If an instance crashes and fails to send a ping for a certain period of time, the Proxy/Router will remove the timed-out instance (this feature has not yet been developed).\n    31\t\n    32\t## KV Cache Transfer Methods\n    33\t\n    34\tThere are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n    35\t\n    36\tExperimental results have shown that the performance of these methods, from highest to lowest, is as follows: PUT_ASYNC → GET → PUT.\n    37\t\n    38\t## P2P Communication via ZMQ & NCCL\n    39\t\n    40\tAs long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.\n    41\t\n    42\tEach P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.\n    43\t\n    44\tWhen a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVcache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.\n    45\t\n    46\t## NCCL Group Topology\n    47\t\n    48\tCurrently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n    49\t\n    50\t![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/837e61d6-365e-4cbf-8640-6dd7ab295b36)\n    51\t\n    52\tEach NCCL group occupies a certain amount of GPU memory buffer for communication, the size of which is primarily influenced by the `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` environment variable. When `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=16`, an NCCL group typically occupies 100MB, while when `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=8`, it usually takes up 52MB. For large-scale xPyD configurations—such as DeepSeek's 96P144D—this implementation is currently not feasible. Moving forward, we are considering using RDMA for point-to-point communication and are also keeping an eye on UCCL.\n    53\t\n    54\t## GPU Memory Buffer and Tensor Memory Pool\n    55\t\n    56\tThe trade-off in the size of the memory buffer is as follows: For P instances, the memory buffer is not required in PUT and PUT_ASYNC modes, but it is necessary in GET mode. For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVcache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVcache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n    57\t\n    58\tIf the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVcache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n    59\t\n    60\tTo address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n    61\t\n    62\t# Install vLLM\n    63\t\n    64\t??? console \"Commands\"\n    65\t\n    66\t    ```shell\n    67\t    # Enter the home directory or your working directory.\n    68\t    cd /home\n    69\t\n    70\t    # Download the installation package, and I will update the commit-id in time.

The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the kvcache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received kvcache will overflow, causing the kvcache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the kvcache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n    89\t- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive kvcache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the kvcache sent to the D instance.\n    90\t- You may need to modify the `kv_buffer_size` and `port` in the following commands (if there is a conflict).\n    91\t- `PUT_ASYNC` offers the best performance and should be prioritized.\n    92\t- The `--port` must be consistent with the `http_port` in the `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    93\t- The `disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py` script will use port 10001 (for receiving client requests) and port 30001 (for receiving service discovery from P and D instances).\n    94\t- The node running the proxy must have `quart` installed.\n    95\t- Supports multiple nodes; you just need to modify the `proxy_ip` and `proxy_port` in `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    96\t- In the following examples, it is assumed that **the proxy's IP is 10.0.1.1**.\n    97\t\n    98\t## Run 1P3D\n    99\t\n   100\t### Proxy (e.g. 10.0.1.1)\n   101\t\n   102\t```shell\n   103\tcd {your vllm directory}/examples/online_serving/disagg_xpyd/\n   104\tpython3 disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py &\n   105\t```\n   106\t\n   107\t### Prefill1 (e.g. 10.0.1.2 or 10.0.1.1)\n   108\t\n   109\t???

The client sends an HTTP request to the Proxy/Router's `/v1/completions` interface.  \n     9\t2. The Proxy/Router selects a **1P1D (1 Prefill instance + 1 Decode instance)** through either through round-robin or random selection, generates a `request_id` (rules to be introduced later), modifies the `max_tokens` in the HTTP request message to **1**, and then forwards the request to the **P instance**.  \n    10\t3. Immediately afterward, the Proxy/Router forwards the **original HTTP request** to the **D instance**.  \n    11\t4. The **P instance** performs **Prefill** and then **actively sends the generated KV cache** to the D instance (using **PUT_ASYNC** mode). The D instance's `zmq_addr` can be resolved through the `request_id`.  \n    12\t5. The **D instance** has a **dedicated thread** for receiving the KV cache (to avoid blocking the main process). The received KV cache is saved into the **GPU memory buffer**, the size of which is determined by the vLLM startup parameter `kv_buffer_size`. When the GPU buffer is full, the KV cache is stored in the **local Tensor memory pool**.  \n    13\t6. During the **Decode**, the D instance's main process retrieves the KV cache (transmitted by the P instance) from either the **GPU buffer** or the **memory pool**, thereby **skipping Prefill**.  \n    14\t7. After completing **Decode**, the D instance returns the result to the **Proxy/Router**, which then forwards it to the **client**.\n    15\t\n    16\t![image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb01bde6-755b-49f7-ad45-48a94b1e10a7)\n    17\t\n    18\t## Proxy/Router (Demo)\n    19\t\n    20\tA simple HTTP service acts as the entry point for client requests and starts a background thread to listen for P/D instances reporting their HTTP IP and PORT, as well as ZMQ IP and PORT. It maintains a dictionary of `http_addr -> zmq_addr`. The `http_addr` is the IP:PORT for the vLLM instance's request, while the `zmq_addr` is the address for KV cache handshake and metadata reception.\n    21\t\n    22\tThe Proxy/Router is responsible for selecting 1P1D based on the characteristics of the client request, such as the prompt, and generating a corresponding `request_id`, for example:\n    23\t\n    24\t```\n    25\tcmpl-___prefill_addr_10.0.1.2:21001___decode_addr_10.0.1.3:22001_93923d63113b4b338973f24d19d4bf11-0\n    26\t```\n    27\t\n    28\tCurrently, to quickly verify whether xPyD can work, a round-robin selection of 1P1D is used. In the future, it is planned to use a trie combined with the load status of instances to select appropriate P and D.\n    29\t\n    30\tEach P/D instance periodically sends a heartbeat packet to the Proxy/Router (currently every 3 seconds) to register (i.e., report `http_addr -> zmq_addr`) and keep the connection alive. If an instance crashes and fails to send a ping for a certain period of time, the Proxy/Router will remove the timed-out instance (this feature has not yet been developed).\n    31\t\n    32\t## KV Cache Transfer Methods\n    33\t\n    34\tThere are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n    35\t\n    36\tExperimental results have shown that the performance of these methods, from highest to lowest, is as follows: PUT_ASYNC → GET → PUT.\n    37\t\n    38\t## P2P Communication via ZMQ & NCCL\n    39\t\n    40\tAs long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.\n    41\t\n    42\tEach P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.\n    43\t\n    44\tWhen a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVcache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.\n    45\t\n    46\t## NCCL Group Topology\n    47\t\n    48\tCurrently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n    49\t\n    50\t![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/837e61d6-365e-4cbf-8640-6dd7ab295b36)\n    51\t\n    52\tEach NCCL group occupies a certain amount of GPU memory buffer for communication, the size of which is primarily influenced by the `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` environment variable. When `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=16`, an NCCL group typically occupies 100MB, while when `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=8`, it usually takes up 52MB. For large-scale xPyD configurations—such as DeepSeek's 96P144D—this implementation is currently not feasible. Moving forward, we are considering using RDMA for point-to-point communication and are also keeping an eye on UCCL.\n    53\t\n    54\t## GPU Memory Buffer and Tensor Memory Pool\n    55\t\n    56\tThe trade-off in the size of the memory buffer is as follows: For P instances, the memory buffer is not required in PUT and PUT_ASYNC modes, but it is necessary in GET mode. For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVcache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVcache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n    57\t\n    58\tIf the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVcache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n    59\t\n    60\tTo address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n    61\t\n    62\t# Install vLLM\n    63\t\n    64\t??? console \"Commands\"\n    65\t\n    66\t    ```shell\n    67\t    # Enter the home directory or your working directory.\n    68\t    cd /home\n    69\t\n    70\t    # Download the installation package, and I will update the commit-id in time.

The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the kvcache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received kvcache will overflow, causing the kvcache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the kvcache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n    89\t- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive kvcache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the kvcache sent to the D instance.\n    90\t- You may need to modify the `kv_buffer_size` and `port` in the following commands (if there is a conflict).\n    91\t- `PUT_ASYNC` offers the best performance and should be prioritized.\n    92\t- The `--port` must be consistent with the `http_port` in the `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    93\t- The `disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py` script will use port 10001 (for receiving client requests) and port 30001 (for receiving service discovery from P and D instances).\n    94\t- The node running the proxy must have `quart` installed.\n    95\t- Supports multiple nodes; you just need to modify the `proxy_ip` and `proxy_port` in `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    96\t- In the following examples, it is assumed that **the proxy's IP is 10.0.1.1**.\n    97\t\n    98\t## Run 1P3D\n    99\t\n   100\t### Proxy (e.g. 10.0.1.1)\n   101\t\n   102\t```shell\n   103\tcd {your vllm directory}/examples/online_serving/disagg_xpyd/\n   104\tpython3 disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py &\n   105\t```\n   106\t\n   107\t### Prefill1 (e.g. 10.0.1.2 or 10.0.1.1)\n   108\t\n   109\t???

The D instance's `zmq_addr` can be resolved through the `request_id`.  \n12:5. The **D instance** has a **dedicated thread** for receiving the KV cache (to avoid blocking the main process). The received KV cache is saved into the **GPU memory buffer**, the size of which is determined by the vLLM startup parameter `kv_buffer_size`. When the GPU buffer is full, the KV cache is stored in the **local Tensor memory pool**.  \n13:6. During the **Decode**, the D instance's main process retrieves the KV cache (transmitted by the P instance) from either the **GPU buffer** or the **memory pool**, thereby **skipping Prefill**.  \n20:A simple HTTP service acts as the entry point for client requests and starts a background thread to listen for P/D instances reporting their HTTP IP and PORT, as well as ZMQ IP and PORT. It maintains a dictionary of `http_addr -> zmq_addr`. The `http_addr` is the IP:PORT for the vLLM instance's request, while the `zmq_addr` is the address for KV cache handshake and metadata reception.\n34:There are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n40:As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.\n42:Each P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.\n44:When a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVcache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.\n48:Currently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n56:The trade-off in the size of the memory buffer is as follows: For P instances, the memory buffer is not required in PUT and PUT_ASYNC modes, but it is necessary in GET mode. For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVcache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVcache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n58:If the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVcache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n60:To address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n88:- Pay attention to the setting of the `kv_buffer_size` (in bytes). The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the kvcache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received kvcache will overflow, causing the kvcache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the kvcache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n89:- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive kvcache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the kvcache sent to the D instance.",

This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n60:To address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\n88:- Pay attention to the setting of the `kv_buffer_size` (in bytes). The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the kvcache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received kvcache will overflow, causing the kvcache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the kvcache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n89:- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive kvcache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the kvcache sent to the D instance.",

Moving forward, we are considering using RDMA for point-to-point communication and are also keeping an eye on UCCL.\n    53\t\n    54\t## GPU Memory Buffer and Tensor Memory Pool\n    55\t\n    56\tThe trade-off in the size of the memory buffer is as follows: For P instances, the memory buffer is not required in PUT and PUT_ASYNC modes, but it is necessary in GET mode. For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVCache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVCache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n    57\t\n    58\tIf the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVcache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVcache loss. Once KVcache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice. Consequently, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) will significantly increase, leading to degraded performance.\n    59\t\n    60\tTo address the above issues, I have designed and developed a local Tensor memory pool for storing KVcache, inspired by the buddy system used in Linux memory modules. Since the memory is sufficiently large, typically in the TB range on servers, there is no need to consider prefix caching or using block-based designs to reuse memory, thereby saving space. When the memory buffer is insufficient, KVcache can be directly stored in the Tensor memory pool, and D instances can subsequently retrieve KVcache from it. The read and write speed is that of PCIe, with PCIe 4.0 having a speed of approximately 21 GB/s, which is usually faster than the Prefill speed. Otherwise, solutions like Mooncake and lmcache would not be necessary. The Tensor memory pool acts as a flood diversion area, typically unused except during sudden traffic surges. In the worst-case scenario, my solution performs no worse than the normal situation with a Cache store.\nReview the changes and make sure they are as expected. Edit the file again if necessary.",

For D instances, a memory buffer is needed in all three modes. The memory buffer for D instances should not be too large. Similarly, for P instances in GET mode, the memory buffer should also not be too large. The memory buffer of D instances is used to temporarily store KVCache sent by P instances. If it is too large, it will reduce the KVCache space available for normal inference by D instances, thereby decreasing the inference batch size and ultimately leading to a reduction in output throughput. The size of the memory buffer is configured by the parameter `kv_buffer_size`, measured in bytes, and is typically set to 5%～10% of the memory size.\n    57\t\n    58\tIf the `--max-num-seqs` parameter for P instances is set to a large value, due to the large batch size, P instances will generate a large amount of KVCache simultaneously. This may exceed the capacity of the memory buffer of D instances, resulting in KVCache loss. Once KVCache is lost, D instances need to recompute Prefill, which is equivalent to performing Prefill twice.

The empirical value is 10% of the GPU memory size. This is related to the KVCache size. If it is too small, the GPU memory buffer for temporarily storing the received KVCache will overflow, causing the KVCache to be stored in the tensor memory pool, which increases latency. If it is too large, the KVCache available for inference will be reduced, leading to a smaller batch size and decreased throughput.\n    89\t- For Prefill instances, when using non-GET mode, the `kv_buffer_size` can be set to 1, as Prefill currently does not need to receive KVCache. However, when using GET mode, a larger `kv_buffer_size` is required because it needs to store the KVCache sent to the D instance.\n    90\t- You may need to modify the `kv_buffer_size` and `port` in the following commands (if there is a conflict).\n    91\t- `PUT_ASYNC` offers the best performance and should be prioritized.\n    92\t- The `--port` must be consistent with the `http_port` in the `--kv-transfer-config`.\n    93\t- The `disagg_prefill_proxy_xpyd.py` script will use port 10001 (for receiving client requests) and port 30001 (for receiving service discovery from P and D instances).\nReview the changes and make sure they are as expected.
