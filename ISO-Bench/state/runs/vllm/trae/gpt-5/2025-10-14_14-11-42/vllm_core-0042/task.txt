I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042.
Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the repository:

<test_script>
# This is a performance optimization task
# The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below
# Focus on performance improvements in the target functions

</test_script>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?

Basic guidelines:
1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.
2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.
3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.
4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.

Follow these steps to improve performance:
1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.
2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.
3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.
4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.

Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to improve performance in this codebase:

 ## KV Cache Transfer Methods
 
-There are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.

 As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.
 
-Each P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.

-When a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.

 ## NCCL Group Topology
 
-Currently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.

IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were successful in a different context.
These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.
Your task is to:
1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros → torch.empty)
2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files
3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations
4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor

The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have these optimizations yet.
You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.

HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization
2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate
3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary
4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code

START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:
```bash
grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_' vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py
```

CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:
- Remove unnecessary tensor filling operations

Target files to optimize:
- docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md
- examples/online_serving/disaggregated_serving_p2p_nccl_xpyd/disagg_proxy_p2p_nccl_xpyd.py
- vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_connector/v1/p2p/p2p_nccl_connector.py

IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.
The task will fail if no files are modified.

## Constraints
- No public API breakage
- All TestPack checks must pass

## Target Files (ONLY modify these)
- `docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md`
- `examples/online_serving/disaggregated_serving_p2p_nccl_xpyd/disagg_proxy_p2p_nccl_xpyd.py`
- `vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_connector/v1/p2p/p2p_nccl_connector.py`
- `vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_connector/v1/p2p/p2p_nccl_engine.py`

## SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
Based on the human commit analysis, focus on these areas:
- Memory allocation patterns (torch.zeros vs torch.empty)
- Tensor initialization strategies
- Kernel parameter optimization
- Buffer reuse and caching

### Human Developer's Approach:

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Start editing files by iteration 3
2. Create and run /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py before and after edits (do not create timing scripts outside /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch)
3. Make at least 3 concrete optimizations
4. Commit changes by iteration 8
5. Use finish command by iteration 10

## TASK COMPLETION COMMAND:
When you have made optimizations:
```bash
git add -A
git reset -q .bench_scratch || true
git commit -m 'Optimize MoE align sum kernels performance'
git diff $(git merge-base HEAD origin/HEAD || git rev-parse HEAD~1) -- . ':(exclude).bench_scratch' > /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/model_patch.diff || true
finish
```

START IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY. NO MORE ANALYSIS.
