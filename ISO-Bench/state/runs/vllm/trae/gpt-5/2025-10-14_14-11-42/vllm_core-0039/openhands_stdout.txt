│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039.                                           │
│ Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the           │

│                                                                              │
│ <test_script>                                                                │

│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039 directory to improve the performance of    │
│ the <test_script>.                                                           │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                      │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce   │
│ and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the     │
│ repo root.                                                                   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │

│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │

│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │

│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │

│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │

│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039 directory to improve the performance of    │
│ the <test_script>.                                                           │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                      │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0039/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce   │
│ and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the     │
│ repo root.                                                                   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │

│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │

│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
