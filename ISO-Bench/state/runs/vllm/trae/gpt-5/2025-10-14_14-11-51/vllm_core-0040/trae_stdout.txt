│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0040 directory to improve the performance of    │
│ the <test_script>.                                                           │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0040/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                      │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0040/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce   │
│ and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the     │
│ repo root.                                                                   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │

│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │

│                                                                              │

│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0040 directory to improve the performance of    │
│ the <test_script>.                                                           │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0040/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                      │
│ /home/raven/coding-mess/kernel-corp/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/w │
│ orktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0040/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce   │
│ and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the     │
│ repo root.                                                                   │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
