  "task": "I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053.\nConsider the following test script showing an example usage of the repository:\n\n<test_script>\n# This is a performance optimization task\n# The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below\n# Focus on performance improvements in the target functions\n\n</test_script>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?\n\nBasic guidelines:\n1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.\n2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.\n3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.\n4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.\n\nFollow these steps to improve performance:\n1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.\n2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.\n3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.\n4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.\n\nHere is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to improve performance in this codebase:\n\n<example_optimization_diff>\ndiff --git a/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py b/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\nindex 122e2ed86..fc585ee9e 100644\n--- a/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\n+++ b/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\n@@ -244,6 +244,7 @@ class LLM:\n             engine_args, usage_context=UsageContext.LLM_CLASS)\n \n         self.request_counter = Counter()\n+        self.default_sampling_params: Union[dict[str, Any], None] = None\n \n     @staticmethod\n     def get_engine_class() -> type[LLMEngine]:\n@@ -268,10 +269,11 @@ class LLM:\n             tokenizer_group.tokenizer = get_cached_tokenizer(tokenizer)\n \n     def get_default_sampling_params(self) -> SamplingParams:\n-        diff_sampling_param = (\n-            self.llm_engine.model_config.get_diff_sampling_param())\n-        if diff_sampling_param:\n-            return SamplingParams.from_optional(**diff_sampling_param)\n+        if self.default_sampling_params is None:\n+            self.default_sampling_params = (\n+                self.llm_engine.model_config.get_diff_sampling_param())\n+        if self.default_sampling_params:\n+            return SamplingParams.from_optional(**self.default_sampling_params)\n         return SamplingParams()\n \n     @overload\ndiff --git a/vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py b/vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py\nindex 98e9ea0fc..f4aaee360 100644\n</example_optimization_diff>\n\nIMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were successful in a different context.\nThese changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.\nYour task is to:\n1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros → torch.empty)\n2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files\n3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations\n4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor\n\nThe codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have these optimizations yet.\nYou need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:\n1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization\n2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate\n3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary\n4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code\n\nSTART WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:\n```bash\ngrep -n 'torch.zeros\\|fill_' vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py\n```\n\nCRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:\n- Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks\n- Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations\n- Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures\n\nTarget files to optimize:\n- vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\n- vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py\n- vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_completion.py\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.\nThe task will fail if no files are modified.\n\n## Constraints\n- No public API breakage\n- All TestPack checks must pass\n\n## Target Files (ONLY modify these)\n- `vllm/entrypoints/llm.py`\n- `vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py`\n- `vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_completion.py`\n- `vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_transcription.py`\n\n## SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:\nBased on the human commit analysis, focus on these areas:\n- Memory allocation patterns (torch.zeros vs torch.empty)\n- Tensor initialization strategies\n- Kernel parameter optimization\n- Buffer reuse and caching\n\n### Human Developer's Approach:\n```\nFix performance when `--generation-config` is not `None` (#14223)\n\nSigned-off-by: Harry Mellor <19981378+hmellor@users.noreply.github.com>\n```\n\n### Files Modified (statistics):\n```\nvllm/entrypoints/llm.py                          | 10 ++++++----\n vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py          | 14 ++++++--------\n vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_completion.py    | 14 ++++++--------\n vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_transcription.py | 10 +++++-----\n 4 files changed, 23 insertions(+), 25 deletions(-)\n```\n\n## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

          "content": "You are Qwen Code, an interactive CLI agent developed by Alibaba Group, specializing in software engineering tasks. Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly, including reasonable, directly implied follow-up actions.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., <class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'> or <class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'>' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>', '<class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>', and '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>', <class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>, '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the <class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'> tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>', <class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>, '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'>' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n7. **END:** If the user is satisfied, mark the task as complete using the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n- **FINISH:** When the user requirements are satisfied and no further todos remain, use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool to mark the task as complete.\n\n## Task Completion and Clarification\n\nUse the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool in these scenarios:\n\n**For Task Completion:**\n- Successfully completed all requested work\n- Provide summary of what was accomplished\n- Include any next steps or recommendations\n- Example: \"Successfully implemented user authentication with JWT tokens. Added login/logout endpoints and protected routes. Tests are passing. Next steps: Review the implementation and deploy to staging environment.\"\n\n**For Clarification Requests:**\n- Missing critical information to proceed\n- Ambiguous requirements need clarification\n- Technical limitations prevent completion\n- User input required for next steps\n- Example: \"I need clarification on the database schema. Should I create a new 'users' table or modify the existing 'accounts' table? Also, what fields are required for user profiles?\"\n\n**For Blocking Issues:**\n- Cannot proceed due to missing dependencies, permissions, or environment issues\n- Need user intervention to resolve technical problems\n- Example: \"Cannot proceed: The project requires Python 3.9+ but the current environment has Python 3.7. Please upgrade Python or provide guidance on how to proceed with the current version.\"\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>' or '<class 'trae_agent.tools.json_edit_tool.JSONEditTool'>'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.bash_tool.BashTool'>' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.todo_write_tool.TodoWriteTool'>' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n- **FINISH:** When the user requirements are satisfied and no further todos remain, use the '<class 'trae_agent.tools.task_done_tool.TaskDoneTool'>' tool to mark the task as complete.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel:\n<tool_call>\n<function=bash>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n<parameter=restart>\nfalse\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=str_replace_based_edit_tool>\n<parameter=command>\nview\n</parameter>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=str_replace_based_edit_tool>\n<parameter=command>\nview\n</parameter>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/src/auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use '<class 'trae_agent.tools.edit_tool.TextEditorTool'>' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved."

Here's the issue text:\nI've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053.\nConsider the following test script showing an example usage of the repository:\n\n<test_script>\n# This is a performance optimization task\n# The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below\n# Focus on performance improvements in the target functions\n\n</test_script>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?\n\nBasic guidelines:\n1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.\n2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.\n3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.\n4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.\n\nFollow these steps to improve performance:\n1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.\n2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.\n3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.\n4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.\n\nHere is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to improve performance in this codebase:\n\n<example_optimization_diff>\ndiff --git a/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py b/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\nindex 122e2ed86..fc585ee9e 100644\n--- a/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\n+++ b/vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\n@@ -244,6 +244,7 @@ class LLM:\n             engine_args, usage_context=UsageContext.LLM_CLASS)\n \n         self.request_counter = Counter()\n+        self.default_sampling_params: Union[dict[str, Any], None] = None\n \n     @staticmethod\n     def get_engine_class() -> type[LLMEngine]:\n@@ -268,10 +269,11 @@ class LLM:\n             tokenizer_group.tokenizer = get_cached_tokenizer(tokenizer)\n \n     def get_default_sampling_params(self) -> SamplingParams:\n-        diff_sampling_param = (\n-            self.llm_engine.model_config.get_diff_sampling_param())\n-        if diff_sampling_param:\n-            return SamplingParams.from_optional(**diff_sampling_param)\n+        if self.default_sampling_params is None:\n+            self.default_sampling_params = (\n+                self.llm_engine.model_config.get_diff_sampling_param())\n+        if self.default_sampling_params:\n+            return SamplingParams.from_optional(**self.default_sampling_params)\n         return SamplingParams()\n \n     @overload\ndiff --git a/vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py b/vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py\nindex 98e9ea0fc..f4aaee360 100644\n</example_optimization_diff>\n\nIMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were successful in a different context.\nThese changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.\nYour task is to:\n1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros → torch.empty)\n2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files\n3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations\n4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor\n\nThe codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have these optimizations yet.\nYou need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:\n1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization\n2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate\n3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary\n4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code\n\nSTART WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:\n```bash\ngrep -n 'torch.zeros\\|fill_' vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py\n```\n\nCRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:\n- Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks\n- Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations\n- Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures\n\nTarget files to optimize:\n- vllm/entrypoints/llm.py\n- vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py\n- vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_completion.py\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.\nThe task will fail if no files are modified.\n\n## Constraints\n- No public API breakage\n- All TestPack checks must pass\n\n## Target Files (ONLY modify these)\n- `vllm/entrypoints/llm.py`\n- `vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py`\n- `vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_completion.py`\n- `vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_transcription.py`\n\n## SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:\nBased on the human commit analysis, focus on these areas:\n- Memory allocation patterns (torch.zeros vs torch.empty)\n- Tensor initialization strategies\n- Kernel parameter optimization\n- Buffer reuse and caching\n\n### Human Developer's Approach:\n```\nFix performance when `--generation-config` is not `None` (#14223)\n\nSigned-off-by: Harry Mellor <19981378+hmellor@users.noreply.github.com>\n```\n\n### Files Modified (statistics):\n```\nvllm/entrypoints/llm.py                          | 10 ++++++----\n vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_chat.py          | 14 ++++++--------\n vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_completion.py    | 14 ++++++--------\n vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_transcription.py | 10 +++++-----\n 4 files changed, 23 insertions(+), 25 deletions(-)\n```\n\n## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Start editing files by iteration 3\n2. Create and run /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py before and after edits (do not create timing scripts outside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/.bench_scratch)\n3. Make at least 3 concrete optimizations\n4. Commit changes by iteration 8\n5. Use finish command by iteration 10\n\n## TASK COMPLETION COMMAND:\nWhen you have made optimizations:\n```bash\ngit add -A\ngit reset -q .bench_scratch || true\ngit commit -m 'Optimize MoE align sum kernels performance'\ngit diff $(git merge-base HEAD origin/HEAD || git rev-parse HEAD~1) -- . ':(exclude).bench_scratch' > /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0053/model_patch.diff || true\nfinish\n```\n\nSTART IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY. NO MORE ANALYSIS.\n\n"

Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters,\n    59\t    this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching\n    60\t    mechanism and efficient memory management.\n    61\t\n    62\t    Args:\n    63\t        model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model.\n    64\t        tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer.\n    65\t        tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer\n    66\t            if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer.\n    67\t        skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and\n    68\t            detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt\n    69\t            from the input.\n    70\t        trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when\n    71\t            downloading the model and tokenizer.\n    72\t        allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images\n    73\t            or videos from directories specified by the server file system.\n    74\t            This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted\n    75\t            environments.\n    76\t        tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed\n    77\t            execution with tensor parallelism.\n    78\t        dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently,\n    79\t            we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use\n    80\t            the `torch_dtype` attribute specified in the model config file.\n    81\t            However, if the `torch_dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will\n    82\t            use `float16` instead.\n    83\t        quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently,\n    84\t            we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental).\n    85\t            If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the\n    86\t            model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are\n    87\t            not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of\n    88\t            the weights.\n    89\t        revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name,\n    90\t            a tag name, or a commit id.\n    91\t        tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a\n    92\t            branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.\n    93\t        seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling.\n    94\t        gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to\n    95\t            reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher\n    96\t            values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's\n    97\t            throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-\n    98\t            memory (OOM) errors.\n    99\t        swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space.\n   100\t            This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests\n   101\t            when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all\n   102\t            requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0.\n   103\t            Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors.\n   104\t        cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading\n   105\t            the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space\n   106\t            you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data\n   107\t            transfer for every forward pass.\n   108\t        enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will\n   109\t            disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode.\n   110\t            If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid.\n   111\t        max_seq_len_to_capture: Maximum sequence len covered by CUDA graphs.\n   112\t            When a sequence has context length larger than this, we fall back\n   113\t            to eager mode. Additionally for encoder-decoder models, if the\n   114\t            sequence length of the encoder input is larger than this, we fall\n   115\t            back to the eager mode.\n   116\t        disable_custom_all_reduce: See :class:`~vllm.config.ParallelConfig`\n   117\t        disable_async_output_proc: Disable async output processing.\n   118\t            This may result in lower performance.\n   119\t        hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the\n   120\t            HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the\n   121\t            HuggingFace config.\n   122\t        compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an\n   123\t            integer, it is used as the level of compilation optimization. If it\n   124\t            is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration.\n   125\t        **kwargs: Arguments for :class:`~vllm.EngineArgs`.

Currently,\n    79\t            we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use\n    80\t            the `torch_dtype` attribute specified in the model config file.\n    81\t            However, if the `torch_dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will\n    82\t            use `float16` instead.\n    83\t        quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently,\n    84\t            we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental).\n    85\t            If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the\n    86\t            model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are\n    87\t            not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of\n    88\t            the weights.\n    89\t        revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name,\n    90\t            a tag name, or a commit id.\n    91\t        tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use.

Higher\n    96\t            values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's\n    97\t            throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-\n    98\t            memory (OOM) errors.\n    99\t        swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space.\n   100\t            This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests\n   101\t            when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1.

Additionally for encoder-decoder models, if the\n   114\t            sequence length of the encoder input is larger than this, we fall\n   115\t            back to the eager mode.\n   116\t        disable_custom_all_reduce: See :class:`~vllm.config.ParallelConfig`\n   117\t        disable_async_output_proc: Disable async output processing.\n   118\t            This may result in lower performance.\n   119\t        hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the\n   120\t            HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the\n   121\t            HuggingFace config.\n   122\t        compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary.

Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters,\n    59\t    this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching\n    60\t    mechanism and efficient memory management.\n    61\t\n    62\t    Args:\n    63\t        model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model.\n    64\t        tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer.\n    65\t        tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer\n    66\t            if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer.\n    67\t        skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and\n    68\t            detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt\n    69\t            from the input.\n    70\t        trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when\n    71\t            downloading the model and tokenizer.\n    72\t        allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images\n    73\t            or videos from directories specified by the server file system.\n    74\t            This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted\n    75\t            environments.\n    76\t        tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed\n    77\t            execution with tensor parallelism.\n    78\t        dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently,\n    79\t            we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use\n    80\t            the `torch_dtype` attribute specified in the model config file.\n    81\t            However, if the `torch_dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will\n    82\t            use `float16` instead.\n    83\t        quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently,\n    84\t            we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental).\n    85\t            If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the\n    86\t            model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are\n    87\t            not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of\n    88\t            the weights.\n    89\t        revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name,\n    90\t            a tag name, or a commit id.\n    91\t        tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a\n    92\t            branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.\n    93\t        seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling.\n    94\t        gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to\n    95\t            reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher\n    96\t            values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's\n    97\t            throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-\n    98\t            memory (OOM) errors.\n    99\t        swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space.\n   100\t            This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests\n   101\t            when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all\n   102\t            requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0.\n   103\t            Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors.\n   104\t        cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading\n   105\t            the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space\n   106\t            you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data\n   107\t            transfer for every forward pass.\n   108\t        enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will\n   109\t            disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode.\n   110\t            If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid.\n   111\t        max_seq_len_to_capture: Maximum sequence len covered by CUDA graphs.\n   112\t            When a sequence has context length larger than this, we fall back\n   113\t            to eager mode. Additionally for encoder-decoder models, if the\n   114\t            sequence length of the encoder input is larger than this, we fall\n   115\t            back to the eager mode.\n   116\t        disable_custom_all_reduce: See :class:`~vllm.config.ParallelConfig`\n   117\t        disable_async_output_proc: Disable async output processing.\n   118\t            This may result in lower performance.\n   119\t        hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the\n   120\t            HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the\n   121\t            HuggingFace config.\n   122\t        compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an\n   123\t            integer, it is used as the level of compilation optimization. If it\n   124\t            is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration.\n   125\t        **kwargs: Arguments for :class:`~vllm.EngineArgs`.
