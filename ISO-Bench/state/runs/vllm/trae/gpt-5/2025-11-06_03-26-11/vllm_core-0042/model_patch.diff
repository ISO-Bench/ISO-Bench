 Each P/D instance periodically sends a heartbeat packet to the Proxy/Router (currently every 3 seconds) to register (i.e., report `http_addr -> zmq_addr`) and keep the connection alive. If an instance crashes and fails to send a ping for a certain period of time, the Proxy/Router will remove the timed-out instance (this feature has not yet been developed).
 
-## KV Cache Transfer Methods
+## KVCache Transfer Methods
 
-There are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.

 Experimental results have shown that the performance of these methods, from highest to lowest, is as follows: PUT_ASYNC → GET → PUT.
 
 ## P2P Communication via ZMQ & NCCL
 
-As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KV cache transfer (using NCCL) can be performed, without being constrained by rank and world size. To support dynamic scaling (expansion and contraction) of instances with PD disaggregation. This means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart.

-Each P/D instance only needs to create a single `P2pNcclEngine` instance. This instance maintains a ZMQ Server, which runs a dedicated thread to listen on the `zmq_addr` address and receive control flow requests from other instances. These requests include requests to establish an NCCL connection and requests to send KVcache metadata (such as tensor shapes and data types). However, it does not actually transmit the KVcache data itself.

-When a P instance and a D instance transmit KVcache for the first time, they need to establish a ZMQ connection and an NCCL group. For subsequent KVcache transmissions, this ZMQ connection and NCCL group are reused. The NCCL group consists of only two ranks, meaning the world size is equal to 2. This design is intended to support dynamic scaling, which means that adding or removing P/D instances does not require a full system restart. As long as the address of the counterpart is known, point-to-point KVcache transmission can be performed, without being restricted by rank or world size.

 ## NCCL Group Topology
 
-Currently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVcache transmission. Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.
