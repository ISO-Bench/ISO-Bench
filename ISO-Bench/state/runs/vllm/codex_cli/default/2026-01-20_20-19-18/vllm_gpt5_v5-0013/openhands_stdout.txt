Summary of changes
- vllm/v1/spec_decode/ngram_proposer.py: Added a fast bytes-level n-gram search path that leverages CPython’s optimized substring search on contiguous int32 views. Falls back to existing KMP logic for safety. This removes Python-level loops and reduces memory traffic during pattern matching.
