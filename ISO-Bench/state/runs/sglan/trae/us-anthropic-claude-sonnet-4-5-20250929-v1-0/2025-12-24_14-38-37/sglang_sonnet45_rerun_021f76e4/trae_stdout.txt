│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_021f76e4 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_021f76e4/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_021f76e4/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/srt/lora/lora_manager.py                                     │
│ - python/sglang/srt/lora/mem_pool.py                                         │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Constraints                                                               │
│ - No public API breakage                                                     │
│ - All TestPack checks must pass                                              │

│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_021f76e4 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_021f76e4/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_021f76e4/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/srt/lora/lora_manager.py                                     │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│             │ │ Optimizations\n\n## Summary\nThis document     │
│             │ │ describes the performance optimizations made   │
│             │ │ to the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) components   │
│             │ │ in SGLang.\n\n## Optimizations Applied\n\n###  │
│             │ │ 1. Replace `torch.zeros` with `torch.empty` in │
│             │ │ lora_manager.py\n\n**Location:**               │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/lora_manager.py`\n\n*… │
│             │ │ Line 80-89: In `init_cuda_graph_batch_info()`, │
│             │ │ replaced 5 `torch.zeros()` calls with          │
│             │ │ `torch.empty()`\n  - `seg_lens`: torch.zeros → │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n  - `seg_indptr`: torch.zeros →   │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n  - `weight_indices`: torch.zeros │
│             │ │ → torch.empty\n  - `lora_ranks`: torch.zeros → │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n  - `scalings`: torch.zeros →     │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n\n- Line 197-207: In              │
│             │ │ `prepare_lora_batch()`, replaced 3             │
│             │ │ `torch.zeros()` calls with `torch.empty()`\n   │
│             │ │ - `seg_indptr`: torch.zeros → torch.empty      │
│             │ │ (with explicit initialization of first         │
│             │ │ element)\n  - `lora_ranks`: torch.zeros →      │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n  - `scalings`: torch.zeros →     │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n\n**Rationale:**\n-               │
│             │ │ `torch.zeros()` allocates memory AND           │
│             │ │ initializes it to zero\n- `torch.empty()` only │
│             │ │ allocates memory without initialization\n-     │
│             │ │ These tensors are immediately filled with      │
│             │ │ actual values, so zero-initialization is       │
│             │ │ wasteful\n- Reduces unnecessary memory writes  │
│             │ │ and improves allocation                        │
│             │ │ performance\n\n**Impact:**\n- Eliminates       │
│             │ │ redundant zero-initialization operations\n-    │
│             │ │ Reduces memory bandwidth usage\n- Particularly │
│             │ │ beneficial on CUDA devices where memory        │
│             │ │ operations are expensive\n\n### 2. Optimize    │
│             │ │ cumsum operation in                            │
│             │ │ lora_manager.py\n\n**Location:**               │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/lora_manager.py`, Line │
│             │ │ 198-199\n\n**Change:**\n```python\n#           │
│             │ │ Before:\nseg_indptr = torch.zeros((bs + 1,),   │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.int32,                             │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\nseg_indptr[1:] =          │
│             │ │ torch.cumsum(seg_lens, dim=0)\n\n#             │
│             │ │ After:\nseg_indptr = torch.empty((bs + 1,),    │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.int32,                             │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\nseg_indptr[0] =           │
│             │ │ 0\ntorch.cumsum(seg_lens, dim=0,               │
│             │ │ out=seg_indptr[1:])\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\n-  │
│             │ │ Uses in-place `out` parameter for cumsum to    │
│             │ │ avoid temporary tensor allocation\n- Only      │
│             │ │ initializes the first element that needs to be │
│             │ │ zero\n- Reduces memory allocations and         │
│             │ │ copies\n\n### 3. Optimize buffer zeroing in    │
│             │ │ mem_pool.py\n\n**Location:**                   │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/mem_pool.py`, Line     │
│             │ │ 168\n\n**Change:**\n```python\n#               │
│             │ │ Before:\nself.A_buffer = 0\n\n#                │
│             │ │ After:\nself.A_buffer.zero_()\n```\n\n**Ratio… │
│             │ │ Direct assignment creates a temporary scalar   │
│             │ │ tensor\n- `.zero_()` is an in-place operation  │
│             │ │ that's more efficient\n- Avoids tensor         │
│             │ │ creation overhead\n\n### 4. Add caching for    │
│             │ │ get_stacked_multiply() in                      │
│             │ │ mem_pool.py\n\n**Location:**                   │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/mem_pool.py`\n\n**Cha… │
│             │ │ Line 50: Added `_stacked_multiply_cache`       │
│             │ │ dictionary to class\n- Line 217-219: Cache     │
│             │ │ lookup for temp_A_buffer loop\n- Line 227-229: │
│             │ │ Cache lookup for temp_B_buffer                 │
│             │ │ loop\n\n**Rationale:**\n-                      │
│             │ │ `get_stacked_multiply()` is called repeatedly  │
│             │ │ in hot loops during weight loading\n- The      │
│             │ │ function performs dictionary lookups that can  │
│             │ │ be cached\n- Module names don't change during  │
│             │ │ runtime, making caching safe\n- Reduces        │
│             │ │ redundant dictionary lookups in                │
│             │ │ performance-critical paths\n\n**Impact:**\n-   │
│             │ │ Eliminates repeated function calls and         │
│             │ │ dictionary lookups\n- Particularly beneficial  │
│             │ │ when loading multiple LoRA adapters or         │
│             │ │ layers\n\n## Performance                       │
│             │ │ Characteristics\n\n### Memory Allocation       │
│             │ │ Improvements\n- **torch.zeros → torch.empty**: │
│             │ │ Eliminates zero-initialization overhead\n  -   │
│             │ │ Saves one memory write pass per tensor\n  -    │
│             │ │ More significant on larger batch sizes and     │
│             │ │ CUDA devices\n  \n### Computational            │
│             │ │ Improvements\n- **Caching stacked multiply     │
│             │ │ values**: Reduces function call overhead\n  -  │
│             │ │ Saves dictionary lookups in nested loops\n  -  │
│             │ │ Benefits increase with number of layers and    │
│             │ │ adapters\n\n### Memory Bandwidth               │
│             │ │ Improvements\n- **In-place operations**:       │
│             │ │ Reduces temporary tensor allocations\n  - Less │
│             │ │ memory traffic\n  - Better cache               │
│             │ │ utilization\n\n## Testing\nA benchmark script  │
│             │ │ was created at `.bench_scratch/test_opt.py` to │
│             │ │ measure the impact of these                    │
│             │ │ optimizations.\n\n## Compatibility\n- All      │
│             │ │ changes maintain the same API and behavior\n-  │
│             │ │ No breaking changes to public interfaces\n-    │
│             │ │ Optimizations are transparent to users\n- Safe │
│             │ │ for CUDA graph capture (existing fill_         │
│             │ │ operations preserved where needed)\n"}         │

│             │ │ lines changed\n\n## Detailed                   │
│             │ │ Optimizations\n\n### 1. Memory Allocation      │
│             │ │ Optimization (torch.zeros →                    │
│             │ │ torch.empty)\n**File**:                        │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/lora_manager.py`\n\n*… │
│             │ │ in `init_cuda_graph_batch_info()` (lines       │
│             │ │ 80-89)**:\n- `seg_lens`: torch.zeros →         │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n- `seg_indptr`: torch.zeros →     │
│             │ │ torch.empty  \n- `weight_indices`: torch.zeros │
│             │ │ → torch.empty\n- `lora_ranks`: torch.zeros →   │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n- `scalings`: torch.zeros →       │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n\n**Changes in                    │
│             │ │ `prepare_lora_batch()` (lines 197-207)**:\n-   │
│             │ │ `seg_indptr`: torch.zeros → torch.empty\n-     │
│             │ │ `lora_ranks`: torch.zeros → torch.empty\n-     │
│             │ │ `scalings`: torch.zeros →                      │
│             │ │ torch.empty\n\n**Rationale**: \n-              │
│             │ │ torch.zeros() allocates AND initializes memory │
│             │ │ to zero\n- torch.empty() only allocates memory │
│             │ │ without initialization\n- These tensors are    │
│             │ │ immediately overwritten with actual values\n-  │
│             │ │ Eliminates unnecessary zero-initialization     │
│             │ │ overhead\n\n**Performance Impact**:\n- Reduced │
│             │ │ memory bandwidth usage\n- Faster tensor        │
│             │ │ allocation\n- Particularly beneficial on CUDA  │
│             │ │ devices\n\n### 2. Cumsum In-Place              │
│             │ │ Optimization\n**File**:                        │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/lora_manager.py`       │
│             │ │ (lines                                         │
│             │ │ 197-199)\n\n**Before**:\n```python\nseg_indptr │
│             │ │ = torch.zeros((bs + 1,), dtype=torch.int32,    │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\nseg_indptr[1:] =          │
│             │ │ torch.cumsum(seg_lens,                         │
│             │ │ dim=0)\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\nseg_ind… │
│             │ │ = torch.empty((bs + 1,), dtype=torch.int32,    │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\nseg_indptr[0] =           │
│             │ │ 0\ntorch.cumsum(seg_lens, dim=0,               │
│             │ │ out=seg_indptr[1:])\n```\n\n**Rationale**:\n-  │
│             │ │ Uses in-place `out` parameter to avoid         │
│             │ │ temporary tensor\n- Only initializes the first │
│             │ │ element that needs to be zero\n- Eliminates    │
│             │ │ intermediate tensor                            │
│             │ │ allocation\n\n**Performance Impact**:\n-       │
│             │ │ Reduced memory allocations\n- Fewer memory     │
│             │ │ copies\n- Lower memory pressure\n\n### 3.      │
│             │ │ Buffer Zeroing Optimization\n**File**:         │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/mem_pool.py` (line     │
│             │ │ 168)\n\n**Before**:\n```python\nself.A_buffer  │
│             │ │ =                                              │
│             │ │ 0\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\nself.A_buffe… │
│             │ │ Direct assignment creates a temporary scalar   │
│             │ │ tensor\n- `.zero_()` is an in-place            │
│             │ │ operation\n- More efficient memory             │
│             │ │ operation\n\n**Performance Impact**:\n- Avoids │
│             │ │ temporary tensor creation\n- More efficient    │
│             │ │ in-place zeroing\n- Reduced overhead in buffer │
│             │ │ management\n\n### 4. Caching Optimization for  │
│             │ │ get_stacked_multiply()\n**File**:              │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/lora/mem_pool.py`\n\n**Cha… │
│             │ │ Line 50: Added `_stacked_multiply_cache: Dict  │

│             │ │ lookup in temp_B_buffer                        │
│             │ │ loop\n\n**Before**:\n```python\nfor name,      │
│             │ │ weights in temp_A_buffer.items():\n    c =     │
│             │ │ get_stacked_multiply(name)\n    # ... use      │
│             │ │ c\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\nfor name,     │
│             │ │ weights in temp_A_buffer.items():\n    if name │
│             │ │ not in self._stacked_multiply_cache:\n         │
│             │ │ self._stacked_multiply_cache =                 │
│             │ │ get_stacked_multiply(name)\n    c =            │
│             │ │ self._stacked_multiply_cache\n    # ... use    │
│             │ │ c\n```\n\n**Rationale**:\n-                    │
│             │ │ `get_stacked_multiply()` performs dictionary   │
│             │ │ lookups\n- Called repeatedly in nested loops   │
│             │ │ during weight loading\n- Module names are      │
│             │ │ constant, making caching safe\n- Eliminates    │
│             │ │ redundant function calls\n\n**Performance      │
│             │ │ Impact**:\n- Reduced function call overhead\n- │
│             │ │ Eliminated repeated dictionary lookups\n-      │
│             │ │ Benefits scale with number of layers and       │
│             │ │ adapters\n\n## Performance                     │
