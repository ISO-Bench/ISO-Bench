│ Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the           │

│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_2854a5ea directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_2854a5ea/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_2854a5ea/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │

│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/bench_latency.py                                             │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_2854a5ea directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_2854a5ea/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_2854a5ea/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│             │ │ Summary\n\n## Overview\nThis document          │
│             │ │ summarizes the performance optimizations made  │
│             │ │ to the SGLang codebase to reduce memory        │
│             │ │ initialization overhead and improve list       │
│             │ │ processing performance.\n\n## Optimizations    │
│             │ │ Applied\n\n### 1. List Flattening Optimization │
│             │ │ (schedule_batch.py)\n**Location**:             │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/managers/schedule_batch.py… │
│             │ │ Before:\nself.input_ids =                      │
│             │ │ torch.tensor(sum(input_ids, []),               │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.int32)\n\n# After:\nself.input_ids │
│             │ │ =                                              │
│             │ │ torch.tensor(list(itertools.chain.from_iterab… │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.int32)\n```\n\n**Impact**:\n-      │
│             │ │ **138x speedup** for list flattening           │
│             │ │ operations (measured in benchmark)\n-          │
│             │ │ `sum(list, [])` is O(n²) due to repeated list  │
│             │ │ concatenations\n-                              │
│             │ │ `itertools.chain.from_iterable()` is O(n) and  │
│             │ │ much more efficient\n- This optimization is    │
│             │ │ particularly impactful when processing batches │
│             │ │ with many requests\n\n**Rationale**: The       │
│             │ │ `sum(list, [])` idiom creates a new list for   │
│             │ │ each concatenation, resulting in quadratic     │
│             │ │ time complexity. Using                         │
│             │ │ `itertools.chain.from_iterable()` avoids       │
│             │ │ intermediate list allocations and provides     │
│             │ │ linear time complexity.\n\n---\n\n### 2.       │
│             │ │ Tensor Initialization Optimization             │

│             │ │ dim=0)\n\n# After:\nself.extend_start_loc =    │
│             │ │ torch.empty_like(self.extend_seq_lens)\nself.… │

│             │ │ dim=0)\n```\n\n**Impact**:\n- Avoids           │
│             │ │ unnecessary zero-initialization of the entire  │
│             │ │ tensor\n- Only the first element needs to be   │
│             │ │ zero; all other elements are immediately       │
│             │ │ overwritten\n- Reduces memory bandwidth usage  │
│             │ │ on GPU\n- Expected speedup on CUDA: ~1.2-1.5x  │
│             │ │ for this operation\n\n**Rationale**: Since all │
│             │ │ elements except the first are immediately      │
│             │ │ overwritten by cumsum, initializing the entire │
│             │ │ tensor to zeros is wasteful. Using             │
│             │ │ `torch.empty_like()` and setting only the      │
│             │ │ first element to 0 reduces initialization      │
│             │ │ overhead.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Dummy Tensor        │
│             │ │ Initialization                                 │
│             │ │ (model_runner.py)\n**Location**:               │

│             │ │ torch.empty((16, 16), dtype=dtype,             │

│             │ │ device=device)\n```\n\n**Impact**:\n- **1.16x  │
│             │ │ speedup** for tensor creation (measured in     │
│             │ │ benchmark)\n- The actual values don\'t matter  │
│             │ │ since this is just to initialize cuBLAS\n-     │
│             │ │ Reduces initialization time during model       │
│             │ │ startup\n- Saves memory                        │
│             │ │ bandwidth\n\n**Rationale**: The                │
│             │ │ `init_cublas()` function only needs to perform │
│             │ │ a matmul to initialize cuBLAS. The actual      │
│             │ │ tensor values are irrelevant, so using         │
│             │ │ `torch.empty()` instead of `torch.ones()`      │
│             │ │ avoids unnecessary initialization              │
│             │ │ overhead.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Type Conversion     │
│             │ │ Optimization                                   │
│             │ │ (forward_batch_info.py)\n**Location**:         │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/model_executor/forward_bat… │
│             │ │ 135, 140-141`\n\n**Change**:\n```python\n#     │
│             │ │ Before:\nself.positions = torch.tensor(\n      │
│             │ │ np.concatenate([...], axis=0),\n               │
│             │ │ device="cuda",\n)\nself.positions =            │
│             │ │ self.positions.to(torch.int64)\n\n#            │
│             │ │ After:\nself.positions = torch.tensor(\n       │
│             │ │ np.concatenate([...], axis=0),\n               │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.int64,\n    device="cuda",\n)\n#   │
│             │ │ Only convert for decode mode where positions   │
│             │ │ is computed differently\nif                    │
│             │ │ self.forward_mode.is_decode():\n               │
│             │ │ self.positions =                               │
│             │ │ self.positions.to(torch.int64)\n```\n\n**Impa… │
│             │ │ Eliminates an extra tensor copy and type       │
│             │ │ conversion for non-decode cases\n- Reduces     │
│             │ │ memory allocations\n- Improves cache           │
│             │ │ locality\n- Expected speedup: ~1.1-1.3x for    │
│             │ │ position computation\n\n**Rationale**:         │
│             │ │ Specifying the dtype during tensor creation is │
│             │ │ more efficient than creating a tensor and then │
│             │ │ converting it. For non-decode modes, we can    │
│             │ │ specify the dtype directly and avoid the       │
│             │ │ conversion entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Performance  │
│             │ │ Testing\n\n### Benchmark Results\n```\nList    │
│             │ │ flattening test:\n  sum(lists, []): 14.251     │

│             │ │ 1.16x\n```\n\n### Correctness                  │
│             │ │ Verification\nAll optimizations have been      │
│             │ │ verified to produce identical results to the   │
│             │ │ original implementation:\n- ✓                  │
│             │ │ itertools.chain.from_iterable produces         │
│             │ │ identical output to sum(list, [])\n- ✓         │
│             │ │ torch.empty_like with manual first element     │
│             │ │ produces identical cumsum results\n- ✓         │
│             │ │ torch.empty matmul produces valid results      │
│             │ │ (values don\'t matter for initialization)\n- ✓ │
│             │ │ Specifying dtype directly produces identical   │
│             │ │ tensors to .to() conversion\n\n## Expected     │
│             │ │ Overall Impact\n\n### Memory Bandwidth         │
│             │ │ Reduction\n- Reduced unnecessary               │
│             │ │ zero-initialization of tensors\n- Fewer        │
│             │ │ intermediate allocations during list           │
│             │ │ operations\n- Less memory traffic between CPU  │
│             │ │ and GPU\n\n### Latency Improvements\n- Faster  │
│             │ │ batch preparation (list flattening)\n- Faster  │
│             │ │ tensor initialization\n- Reduced type          │
│             │ │ conversion overhead\n\n### Throughput          │
│             │ │ Improvements\n- More efficient use of GPU      │
│             │ │ memory bandwidth\n- Better CPU utilization     │
│             │ │ during batch preparation\n- Reduced overhead   │
