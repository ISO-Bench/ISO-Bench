│ Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the           │

│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_9c745d07 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_9c745d07/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_9c745d07/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_9c745d07 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_9c745d07/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_9c745d07/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │

│             │ │ Summary\n\n## Overview\nThis document          │
│             │ │ summarizes the performance optimizations made  │
│             │ │ to the SGLang codebase, focusing on memory     │
│             │ │ allocation, tensor operations, and algorithmic │
│             │ │ improvements.\n\n## Optimizations              │
│             │ │ Applied\n\n### 1. Direct Device Tensor         │
│             │ │ Creation                                       │
│             │ │ (sampling_batch_info.py)\n**Location**:        │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/sampling/sampling_batch_in… │
│             │ │ = (\n    torch.tensor(\n        ,\n            │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.float,\n    )\n    .view(-1, 1)\n  │
│             │ │ .to(device,                                    │
│             │ │ non_blocking=True)\n)\n```\n\n**After**:\n```… │
│             │ │ = torch.tensor(\n    ,\n                       │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.float,\n                           │
│             │ │ device=device,\n).view(-1,                     │
│             │ │ 1)\n```\n\n**Impact**: Eliminates unnecessary  │
│             │ │ CPU-to-GPU memory transfers by creating        │
│             │ │ tensors directly on the target device. This    │
│             │ │ applies to `temperatures`, `top_ps`, `top_ks`, │
│             │ │ and `min_ps` tensors.\n\n### 2. Optimized      │
│             │ │ Tensor Filling                                 │
│             │ │ (sampling_batch_info.py)\n**Location**:        │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/sampling/sampling_batch_in… │
│             │ │ torch.dtype(dtype):\n    if lhs is None:\n     │
│             │ │ lhs = torch.empty((bs1, *shape),               │
│             │ │ device=device).fill_(default)\n    if rhs is   │
│             │ │ None:\n        rhs = torch.empty((bs2,         │
│             │ │ *shape),                                       │
│             │ │ device=device).fill_(default)\n```\n\n**After… │
│             │ │ lhs is None:\n    lhs = torch.full((bs1,       │
│             │ │ *shape), default, dtype=dtype,                 │
│             │ │ device=device)\nif rhs is None:\n    rhs =     │
│             │ │ torch.full((bs2, *shape), default,             │
│             │ │ dtype=dtype,                                   │
│             │ │ device=device)\n```\n\n**Impact**: Uses        │
│             │ │ `torch.full` instead of                        │
│             │ │ `torch.empty().fill_()` which is more          │
│             │ │ efficient and clearer. Also removes            │
│             │ │ unnecessary `with torch.dtype(dtype)` context  │
│             │ │ manager.\n\n### 3. Cached Batch Size           │
│             │ │ Computation                                    │
│             │ │ (sampling_batch_info.py)\n**Location**:        │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/sampling/sampling_batch_in… │
│             │ │ = torch.zeros(\n    len(self.temperatures),\n  │
│             │ │ self.vocab_size,\n                             │
│             │ │ ...\n)\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\nbatch_s… │
│             │ │ = len(self.temperatures)\nself.vocab_mask =    │
│             │ │ torch.zeros(\n    batch_size,\n                │
│             │ │ self.vocab_size,\n                             │
│             │ │ ...\n)\n```\n\n**Impact**: Caches the batch    │
│             │ │ size to avoid repeated `len()` calls,          │
│             │ │ improving readability and potential            │
│             │ │ performance.\n\n### 4. Optimized List          │

│             │ │ jump_forward_bytes[0] in continuation_range:\n │
│             │ │ byte_edge = jump_forward_bytes\n               │
│             │ │ suffix_bytes.append(byte_edge[0])\n            │
│             │ │ cur_state = byte_edge[1]\n    idx += 1\n\ndel  │
│             │ │ jump_forward_bytes[:idx]\n```\n\n**Impact**:   │
│             │ │ Replaces O(n) `pop(0)` operations with O(1)    │
│             │ │ indexing, followed by a single O(n) slice      │
│             │ │ deletion. This is significantly faster for     │
│             │ │ lists with multiple elements.\n\n### 5.        │
│             │ │ Optimized String Formatting                    │
│             │ │ (outlines_backend.py)\n**Location**:           │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/constrained/outlines_backe… │
│             │ │ = [f"<0x{hex(b)[2:].upper()}>" for b in        │
│             │ │ suffix_bytes]\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\n… │
│             │ │ = \n```\n\n**Impact**: Uses direct format      │
│             │ │ specifier `:02X` instead of                    │
│             │ │ `hex()[2:].upper()`, which is more efficient   │
│             │ │ and cleaner.\n\n### 6. Optimized Loop with zip │
│             │ │ (xgrammar_backend.py)\n**Location**:           │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/constrained/xgrammar_backe… │
│             │ │ = 0\nfor i, old_id in                          │
│             │ │ enumerate(old_output_ids):\n    if old_id ==   │
│             │ │ new_output_ids:\n        k = i + 1\n           │
│             │ │ else:\n                                        │
│             │ │ break\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\nk =       │
│             │ │ 0\nfor old_id, new_id in zip(old_output_ids,   │
│             │ │ new_output_ids):\n    if old_id == new_id:\n   │
│             │ │ k += 1\n    else:\n                            │
│             │ │ break\n```\n\n**Impact**: Uses `zip` to        │
│             │ │ iterate over both lists simultaneously,        │
│             │ │ avoiding manual indexing which is cleaner and  │
│             │ │ potentially faster.\n\n## Performance          │
│             │ │ Impact\n\nThe optimizations focus on:\n1.      │
│             │ │ **Memory efficiency**: Direct device           │
│             │ │ allocation reduces memory copies\n2.           │
│             │ │ **Computational efficiency**: Better           │
│             │ │ algorithms (O(1) vs O(n) operations)\n3.       │
│             │ │ **Code clarity**: Cleaner, more Pythonic code  │
│             │ │ that\'s easier to maintain\n\n##               │
│             │ │ Testing\n\nAll optimizations maintain          │
│             │ │ functional equivalence with the original code  │
│             │ │ while improving performance. The changes have  │
│             │ │ been tested with the benchmark script in       │
│             │ │ `.bench_scratch/test_opt.py`.\n\n## Files      │
