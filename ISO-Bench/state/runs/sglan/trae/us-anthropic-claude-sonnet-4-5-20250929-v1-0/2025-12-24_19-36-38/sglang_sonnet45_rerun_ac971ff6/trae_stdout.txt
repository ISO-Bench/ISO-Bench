│ Task: I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory                │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6.                                                │
│ Consider the following test script showing an example usage of the           │

│                                                                              │
│ <test_script>                                                                │

│ # The specific operations to optimize are in the files listed below          │
│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │
│                                                                              │
│ </test_script>                                                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/srt/server_args.py                                           │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│ - No public API breakage                                                     │
│ - All TestPack checks must pass                                              │

│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_ac971ff6/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/srt/server_args.py                                           │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│             │ │ _DATACLASS_FIELDS_CACHE is None:\n             │
│             │ │ _DATACLASS_FIELDS_CACHE = tuple(attr.name for  │
│             │ │ attr in dataclasses.fields(cls))\n\nargs_dict  │
│             │ │ = args.__dict__\nreturn cls(**{attr: args_dict │
│             │ │ for attr in                                    │
│             │ │ _DATACLASS_FIELDS_CACHE})\n```\n\n**Benefit:** │
│             │ │ Avoids repeated dataclass introspection and    │
│             │ │ uses direct dictionary access instead of       │
│             │ │ `getattr()`.\n\n### 2. Faster Random Number    │
│             │ │ Generation\n**Before:**\n```python\nself.rand… │
│             │ │ = random.randint(0, 1 <<                       │
│             │ │ 30)\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\nself.rando… │
│             │ │ = random.getrandbits(30)\n```\n\n**Benefit:**  │
│             │ │ `getrandbits()` is faster than `randint()` for │
│             │ │ generating random integers.\n\n### 3.          │
│             │ │ Optimized additional_ports                     │
│             │ │ Handling\n**Before:**\n```python\nif           │
│             │ │ isinstance(self.additional_ports, int):\n      │
│             │ │ self.additional_ports = \nelif                 │
│             │ │ self.additional_ports is None:\n               │
│             │ │ self.additional_ports =                        │
│             │ │ []\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\nif           │
│             │ │ self.additional_ports is None:\n               │
│             │ │ self.additional_ports = []\nelif               │
│             │ │ isinstance(self.additional_ports, int):\n      │
│             │ │ self.additional_ports = \n```\n\n**Benefit:**  │
│             │ │ Checks the most common case (None) first,      │
│             │ │ reducing average branch prediction             │
│             │ │ misses.\n\n### 4. Reduced Attribute Access     │
│             │ │ Overhead\n**Before:**\n```python\nif           │
│             │ │ self.tp_size >= 16:\n                          │
│             │ │ self.mem_fraction_static = 0.74\nelif          │
│             │ │ self.tp_size >= 8:\n                           │
│             │ │ ...\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\ntp =        │
│             │ │ self.tp_size\nif tp >= 16:\n                   │
│             │ │ self.mem_fraction_static = 0.74\nelif tp >=    │
│             │ │ 8:\n    ...\n```\n\n**Benefit:** Reduces       │
│             │ │ repeated attribute lookups by storing in a     │
│             │ │ local variable.\n\n### 5. String Concatenation │
│             │ │ Instead of                                     │
│             │ │ F-Strings\n**Before:**\n```python\ndef         │
│             │ │ url(self):\n    return                         │
│             │ │ f"http://{self.host}:{self.port}"\n\ndef       │
│             │ │ print_mode_args(self):\n    return (\n         │
│             │ │ f"disable_flashinfer={self.disable_flashinfer… │
│             │ │ "\n                                            │
│             │ │ f"attention_reduce_in_fp32={self.attention_re… │
│             │ │ "\n        ...\n                               │
│             │ │ )\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\ndef           │
│             │ │ url(self):\n    return "http://" + self.host + │
│             │ │ ":" + str(self.port)\n\ndef                    │
│             │ │ print_mode_args(self):\n    return (\n         │
│             │ │ "disable_flashinfer=" +                        │
│             │ │ str(self.disable_flashinfer) + ", "\n          │
│             │ │ "attention_reduce_in_fp32=" +                  │
│             │ │ str(self.attention_reduce_in_fp32) + ", "\n    │
│             │ │ ...\n    )\n```\n\n**Benefit:** String         │
│             │ │ concatenation can be faster than f-strings for │
│             │ │ simple cases, especially when called           │
│             │ │ frequently.\n\n## Benchmark Results\n\n###     │

│                         6 Optimizations Implemented                          │
│                                                                              │
│  1 Cached Dataclass Fields - Added _DATACLASS_FIELDS_CACHE module variable   │
│    to avoid repeated dataclasses.fields() introspection                      │
│  2 Faster Random Generation - Changed random.randint(0, 1<<30) to            │
│    random.getrandbits(30)                                                    │
│  3 Optimized Branch Order - Reordered additional_ports checks to test None   │
│    first (most common case)                                                  │
│  4 Reduced Attribute Access - Store self.tp_size in local variable tp to     │
│    avoid repeated lookups                                                    │
│  5 Direct Dictionary Access - Use args.__dict__[attr] instead of             │
│    getattr(args, attr) for faster access                                     │
│  6 String Concatenation - Replace f-strings with string concatenation in     │
│    url() and print_mode_args() methods                                       │
