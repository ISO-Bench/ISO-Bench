│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_915140fd directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_915140fd/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_915140fd/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_915140fd directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_915140fd/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_915140fd/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │

│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │

│             │ │ in MoE (Mixture of Experts) related code to    │
│             │ │ reduce unnecessary zero-initialization         │
│             │ │ overhead.\n\n## Optimizations Made\n\n### 1.   │
│             │ │ python/sglang/srt/layers/moe/ep_moe/layer.py\… │
│             │ │ Optimization 1.1: Expert Mask Initialization   │
│             │ │ (Line 354-360)\n- **Before**: `torch.zeros()`  │
│             │ │ + fill all but last element with 1\n-          │
│             │ │ **After**: `torch.ones()` + set last element   │
│             │ │ to 0\n- **Benefit**: Reduces memory writes     │
│             │ │ from N-1 to 1, where N is                      │
│             │ │ num_local_experts+1\n\n#### Optimization 1.2:  │
│             │ │ Input Tensor Scale Buffer (Line 505-510)\n-    │
│             │ │ **Before**: `torch.zeros()` with transpose\n-  │
│             │ │ **After**: `torch.empty()` with correct        │
│             │ │ dimensions (no transpose needed)\n-            │
│             │ │ **Benefit**: Eliminates unnecessary            │
│             │ │ zero-initialization and transpose operation\n- │
│             │ │ **Note**: Removed TODO comment as the tensor   │

│             │ │ **Benefit**: Only initializes the single       │
│             │ │ element that needs to be zero (position        │
│             │ │ 0)\n\n#### Optimization 2.3: Segment and Mask  │
│             │ │ Buffers in moe_ep_deepgemm_preprocess (Line    │
│             │ │ 1258-1261)\n- **Before**: `torch.zeros()` for  │
│             │ │ seg_indptr and masked_m\n- **After**: \n  -    │
│             │ │ seg_indptr: `torch.empty()` + `seg_indptr[0] = │
│             │ │ 0`\n  - masked_m: `torch.empty()` (all         │
│             │ │ positions written by kernel)\n- **Benefit**:   │
│             │ │ Eliminates unnecessary zero-initialization for │
│             │ │ buffers that are fully written by              │
│             │ │ kernels\n\n### 3.                              │

│             │ │ Optimization 3.1: Cache Location Tensors (Line │
│             │ │ 1102, 1109)\n- **Before**: `torch.zeros(0,     │
│             │ │ ...)` for empty tensors\n- **After**:          │
│             │ │ `torch.empty(0, ...)` for empty tensors\n-     │
│             │ │ **Benefit**: Minor optimization for            │
│             │ │ consistency (empty tensors have no elements to │
│             │ │ initialize)\n\n## Performance Impact\n\nThese  │
│             │ │ optimizations reduce memory allocation and     │
│             │ │ initialization overhead in the MoE processing  │
│             │ │ pipeline:\n\n1. **Reduced Memory Writes**:     │
│             │ │ Eliminates unnecessary zero-initialization of  │
│             │ │ large buffers\n2. **Fewer Operations**:        │
│             │ │ Removes redundant transpose operations\n3.     │
│             │ │ **Better Cache Efficiency**: Fewer memory      │
│             │ │ writes means better cache utilization\n\nThe   │
│             │ │ optimizations are particularly beneficial      │
│             │ │ for:\n- Large expert counts (num_experts =     │
│             │ │ 64-256)\n- High token counts (num_tokens =     │
│             │ │ 4096+)\n- Frequent MoE layer invocations       │
│             │ │ during inference\n\n## Correctness             │
│             │ │ Verification\n\nAll optimizations maintain     │
│             │ │ functional equivalence:\n- Buffers that are    │
│             │ │ fully written by kernels use                   │
│             │ │ `torch.empty()`\n- Index pointer arrays        │
│             │ │ (indptr) only initialize position 0 to 0, as   │
│             │ │ required by cumsum semantics\n- Expert masks   │
│             │ │ use `torch.ones()` + single write instead of   │
│             │ │ `torch.zeros()` + multiple writes\n- Empty     │
│             │ │ tensors (size 0) use `torch.empty()` as        │
│             │ │ initialization doesn't matter\n"}              │

│             │ │ Performance Benefits\n\n1. **Reduced Memory    │
│             │ │ Initialization**: Eliminates unnecessary       │
│             │ │ zero-initialization of large buffers\n2.       │
│             │ │ **Fewer Memory Writes**: Expert mask changes   │
│             │ │ from O(N-1) writes to O(1) writes\n3.          │
│             │ │ **Removed Redundant Operations**: Eliminates   │
│             │ │ unnecessary transpose operations\n4. **Better  │
│             │ │ Cache Efficiency**: Fewer memory operations    │
│             │ │ improve cache utilization\n\n## Impact         │
│             │ │ Scenarios\n\nThese optimizations are           │
│             │ │ particularly beneficial for:\n- **Large expert │
│             │ │ counts**: 64-256 experts\n- **High token       │
│             │ │ counts**: 4096+ tokens per batch\n- **Frequent │
│             │ │ MoE invocations**: Multiple MoE layers in deep │
│             │ │ models\n\n## Verification\n\n```bash\n# Verify │
│             │ │ patch file exists and is valid\nls -lh         │
│             │ │ model_patch.diff\nfile model_patch.diff\n\n#   │
│             │ │ Check patch statistics\nwc -l                  │
│             │ │ model_patch.diff\ngit diff --stat HEAD~1       │
│             │ │ HEAD\n\n# Verify changes in source files\ngrep │
│             │ │ "torch.ones"                                   │

│             │ │ Test patch applicability\ngit apply --check    │
│             │ │ model_patch.diff\n```\n\n## Correctness\n\nAll │
│             │ │ optimizations maintain functional              │
│             │ │ equivalence:\n- Buffers fully written by       │
│             │ │ kernels use `torch.empty()`\n- Index pointer   │
│             │ │ arrays only initialize position 0 (required by │
│             │ │ cumsum semantics)\n- Expert masks use more     │
│             │ │ efficient initialization pattern\n- Empty      │
│             │ │ tensors (size 0) don\'t need                   │
│             │ │ initialization\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe patch   │
│             │ │ contains **7 concrete optimizations** across   │
│             │ │ **3 files** that reduce memory allocation      │
│             │ │ overhead in MoE operations while maintaining   │
│             │ │ functional correctness.\n'}                    │
