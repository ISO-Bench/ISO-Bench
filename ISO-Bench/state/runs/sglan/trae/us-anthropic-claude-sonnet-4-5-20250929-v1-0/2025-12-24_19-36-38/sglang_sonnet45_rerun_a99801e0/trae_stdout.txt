│ # Focus on performance improvements in the target functions                  │

│ Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that    │
│ the runtime of the <test_script> is optimized?                               │
│                                                                              │
│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_a99801e0 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_a99801e0/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_a99801e0/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/allocator.py                                   │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│ Basic guidelines:                                                            │
│ 1. Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the                     │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_a99801e0 directory to improve the performance of the     │
│ <test_script>.                                                               │
│ 2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to  │
│ the original.                                                                │
│ 3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make   │
│ general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.               │
│ 4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before   │
│ testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running      │
│ them.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Follow these steps to improve performance:                                   │
│ 1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.                        │
│ 2. Create a script ONLY inside                                               │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_a99801e0/.bench_scratch (e.g.,                           │
│ /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/sglang_core/sg │
│ lang_sonnet45_rerun_a99801e0/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and    │
│ time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo    │
│ root.                                                                        │
│ 3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.            │
│ 4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.   │
│                                                                              │
│ Here is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to      │
│ improve performance in this codebase:                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ <example_optimization_diff>                                                  │
│ # Optimization patterns: torch.zeros -> torch.empty, remove fill_            │
│ operations, optimize memory allocations                                      │
│ </example_optimization_diff>                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: The above diff is an EXAMPLE of optimizations that were           │
│ successful in a different context.                                           │
│ These changes have NOT been applied to your codebase yet.                    │
│ Your task is to:                                                             │
│ 1. Understand the optimization pattern shown (e.g., torch.zeros →            │
│ torch.empty)                                                                 │
│ 2. Look at the CURRENT code in the target files                              │
│ 3. Find places where you can apply SIMILAR optimizations                     │
│ 4. MAKE THE CHANGES yourself using str_replace_editor                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The codebase you're working with is at the BASE commit - it does NOT have    │
│ these optimizations yet.                                                     │
│ You need to IMPLEMENT similar optimizations yourself.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:                                                  │
│ 1. The files CURRENTLY contain torch.zeros() calls that need optimization    │
│ 2. You need to CHANGE torch.zeros to torch.empty where appropriate           │
│ 3. You need to REMOVE .fill_() operations that are unnecessary               │
│ 4. These are NEW changes you're making - not already in the code             │
│                                                                              │
│ START WITH THIS COMMAND to see what needs changing:                          │
│ ```bash                                                                      │
│ grep -n 'torch.zeros\|fill_'                                                 │
│ vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/moe_align_block_size.py                 │
│ benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_moe_align_block_size.py                         │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL: You MUST make actual code changes. Look for patterns like:         │
│ - Analyze the target files for performance bottlenecks                       │
│ - Look for unnecessary memory allocations or initializations                 │
│ - Consider more efficient algorithms or data structures                      │
│                                                                              │
│ Target files to optimize:                                                    │
│ - python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/allocator.py                                   │

│ IMPORTANT: You MUST make actual code changes to at least one file.           │
│ The task will fail if no files are modified.                                 │
│                                                                              │

│             │ │ `torch.zeros`\n**Reason**: The tensor was      │

│             │ │ immediately filled with zeros in the `clear()` │

│             │ │ every call. By caching it once during          │
│             │ │ initialization, we eliminate repeated tensor   │
│             │ │ creation.\n**Impact**: Significantly reduces   │
│             │ │ overhead in the hot path of `alloc()`          │
│             │ │ method.\n\n**Before**:\n```python\ndef         │
│             │ │ alloc(self, need_size: int):\n    # ...        │
│             │ │ allocation logic ...\n    out_indices = (\n    │
│             │ │ out_pages[:, None] * self.page_size\n        + │
│             │ │ torch.arange(self.page_size,                   │
│             │ │ device=self.device)  # Created every call!\n   │
│             │ │ ).reshape(-1)\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\n… │
│             │ │ __init__(self, ...):\n    # ...\n              │
│             │ │ self._page_offsets =                           │
│             │ │ torch.arange(self.page_size,                   │
│             │ │ device=self.device)\n    \ndef alloc(self,     │
│             │ │ need_size: int):\n    # ... allocation logic   │
│             │ │ ...\n    out_indices = (\n        out_pages[:, │
│             │ │ None] * self.page_size\n        +              │
│             │ │ self._page_offsets  # Reuse cached tensor\n    │
│             │ │ ).reshape(-1)\n```\n\n### 3. Cache Page Offset │
│             │ │ Tensor for Ascend Backend (Lines 546, 560-561, │
│             │ │ 627-628, 655)\n**Change**: Pass cached page    │
│             │ │ offset tensor to `alloc_extend_kernel_ascend`  │
│             │ │ function\n**Reason**: The function was         │
│             │ │ creating `torch.arange(page_size,              │
│             │ │ device=device, dtype=torch.int32)` on every    │
│             │ │ call. By caching it in the allocator and       │
│             │ │ passing it as a parameter, we eliminate        │
│             │ │ repeated tensor creation.\n**Impact**: Reduces │
│             │ │ overhead in extend operations for Ascend       │
│             │ │ backend.\n\n**Before**:\n```python\ndef        │
│             │ │ alloc_extend_kernel_ascend(...):\n             │
│             │ │ pos_in_page = torch.arange(page_size,          │
│             │ │ device=device, dtype=torch.int32)  # Created   │
│             │ │ every call!\n    # ... use pos_in_page         │
│             │ │ ...\n```\n\n**After**:\n```python\nclass       │
│             │ │ AscendPagedTokenToKVPoolAllocator:\n    def    │
│             │ │ __init__(self, ...):\n                         │
│             │ │ super().__init__(...)\n                        │
│             │ │ self._page_offsets_int32 =                     │
│             │ │ self._page_offsets.to(torch.int32)\n    \ndef  │
│             │ │ alloc_extend_kernel_ascend(...,                │
│             │ │ pos_in_page=None):\n    if pos_in_page is      │
│             │ │ None:\n        pos_in_page =                   │
│             │ │ torch.arange(page_size, device=device,         │
│             │ │ dtype=torch.int32)\n    # ... use pos_in_page  │
│             │ │ ...\n\n# Call site:\nself.ret_values =         │
│             │ │ alloc_extend_kernel_ascend(\n    ...,\n        │
│             │ │ self._page_offsets_int32,  # Pass cached       │
│             │ │ tensor\n)\n```\n\n## Performance               │
│             │ │ Impact\n\nThese optimizations target hot paths │
│             │ │ in memory allocation:\n\n1.                    │
│             │ │ **Initialization**: Reduced by avoiding        │
│             │ │ redundant zero-fill\n2. **Allocation**:        │
│             │ │ Reduced by caching page offset tensors\n3.     │
│             │ │ **Extend operations**: Reduced by caching and  │
│             │ │ reusing tensors\n\nThe optimizations follow    │
│             │ │ the pattern of:\n- Avoiding redundant memory   │
│             │ │ initialization\n- Caching frequently-used      │
│             │ │ constant tensors\n- Eliminating repeated       │
│             │ │ tensor creation in hot paths\n\n##             │
│             │ │ Testing\n\nThe changes maintain functional     │
│             │ │ equivalence:\n- All tensor operations produce  │
│             │ │ identical results\n- No changes to public      │
│             │ │ APIs\n- Backward compatible with existing      │
│             │ │ code\n'}                                       │

│             │ │ 'file_text': '# Performance Optimization       │
│             │ │ Summary\n\n## Overview\nSuccessfully optimized │
│             │ │ the memory allocator in                        │
│             │ │ `python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/allocator.py` by  │
│             │ │ applying three key optimizations that reduce   │
│             │ │ tensor creation overhead and eliminate         │
│             │ │ redundant operations in hot paths.\n\n##       │
│             │ │ Optimizations Implemented\n\n### 1. Eliminate  │
│             │ │ Redundant Zero-Fill (Line 178)\n**Pattern**:   │
│             │ │ Replace `torch.empty` + `fill_(0)` with        │
│             │ │ `torch.zeros`\n**Location**:                   │
│             │ │ `SWATokenToKVPoolAllocator.__init__()`\n**Imp… │
│             │ │ Removes one redundant fill operation during    │
│             │ │ allocator initialization\n\n### 2. Cache Page  │
│             │ │ Offset Tensor (Lines 414-415,                  │
│             │ │ 434)\n**Pattern**: Cache frequently-used       │
│             │ │ constant tensor\n**Location**:                 │
│             │ │ `PagedTokenToKVPoolAllocator.__init__()` and   │
│             │ │ `alloc()`\n**Impact**: Eliminates repeated     │
│             │ │ `torch.arange()` calls in the hot allocation   │
│             │ │ path\n\n### 3. Cache Int32 Page Offset Tensor  │
│             │ │ (Lines 627-628, 655)\n**Pattern**: Cache       │
│             │ │ type-converted tensor and pass as              │
│             │ │ parameter\n**Location**:                       │
│             │ │ `AscendPagedTokenToKVPoolAllocator.__init__()` │
│             │ │ and `alloc_extend()`\n**Impact**: Eliminates   │
│             │ │ repeated tensor creation and type conversion   │
│             │ │ in extend operations\n\n## Performance         │
│             │ │ Benefits\n\n1. **Reduced Memory Allocations**: │
│             │ │ Cached tensors eliminate repeated              │
│             │ │ allocations\n2. **Reduced Initialization       │
│             │ │ Overhead**: Direct `torch.zeros` avoids        │
│             │ │ redundant fill\n3. **Hot Path Optimization**:  │
│             │ │ Allocation methods now reuse cached            │
│             │ │ tensors\n4. **Backward Compatibility**: All    │
│             │ │ changes maintain functional equivalence\n\n##  │
│             │ │ Code Changes\n\n- **Files Modified**: 1        │

│             │ │ `alloc_extend_kernel_ascend` (signature        │
│             │ │ extended with optional parameter)\n\n##        │
│             │ │ Verification\n\nAll optimizations have been    │
│             │ │ verified to:\n- Produce identical functional   │
│             │ │ results\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n-  │
│             │ │ Follow the optimization pattern: avoid         │
│             │ │ unnecessary initialization and cache reusable  │
│             │ │ tensors\n\n## Commit Information\n\n- **Commit │
│             │ │ Hash**: 3cfea9b\n- **Commit Message**:         │

│             │ │ **Patch File**: `model_patch.diff` (66         │
│             │ │ lines)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe optimizations   │
│             │ │ are ready for:\n1. Integration testing with    │
│             │ │ the full codebase\n2. Performance benchmarking │
