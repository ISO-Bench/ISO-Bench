Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042 directory to improve the performance of the <test_script>.\n2. Make changes while ensuring the repository is functionally equivalent to the original.\n3. Do not overoptimize for just the specific inputs in <test_script>. Make general performance improvements for the usage scenario shown.\n4. You may need to rebuild the repo for your changes to take effect before testing. Some rebuilds may take time to run, so be patient with running them.\n\nFollow these steps to improve performance:\n1. As a first step, explore the repository structure.\n2. Create a script ONLY inside /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch (e.g., /home/ubuntu/OmniPerf-Bench/perf-agents-bench/.work/worktrees/vllm_core/vllm_core-0042/.bench_scratch/test_opt.py) to reproduce and time the example, then execute it with python <filename.py> from the repo root.\n3. Edit the source code of the repository to improve performance.\n4. Rebuild and rerun your script to confirm that performance has improved.\n\nHere is an example of the kind of optimizations that have been shown to improve performance in this codebase:\n\n<example_optimization_diff>\ndiff --git a/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md b/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md\nindex b1df93cfc..8f6a2b3b2 100644\n--- a/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md\n+++ b/docs/design/v1/p2p_nccl_connector.md\n@@ -31,7 +31,7 @@ Each P/D instance periodically sends a heartbeat packet to the Proxy/Router (cur\n \n ## KV Cache Transfer Methods\n \n-There are three methods for KVcache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC. These methods can be specified using the `--kv-transfer-config` and `kv_connector_extra_config` parameters, specifically through the `send_type` field. Both PUT and PUT_ASYNC involve the P instance actively sending KVcache to the D instance. The difference is that PUT is a synchronous transfer method that blocks the main process, while PUT_ASYNC is an asynchronous transfer method. PUT_ASYNC uses a dedicated thread for sending KVcache, which means it does not block the main process. In contrast, the GET method involves the P instance saving the KVcache to the memory buffer after computing the prefill. The D instance then actively retrieves the computed KVcache from the P instance once it has allocated space for the KVcache.\n+There are three methods for KVCache transfer: PUT, GET, and PUT_ASYNC.

Asymmetric TP and PP (Pipeline Parallelism) methods will be supported in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the 1P2D setup, where each instance has a TP (Tensor Parallelism) degree of 2. There are a total of 7 NCCL groups: three vLLM instances each have one NCCL group with TP=2. Additionally, the 0th GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 0th GPU card of each D instance. Similarly, the 1st GPU card of the P instance establishes an NCCL group with the 1st GPU card of each D instance.\n+Currently, only symmetric TP (Tensor Parallelism) methods are supported for KVCache transmission.
