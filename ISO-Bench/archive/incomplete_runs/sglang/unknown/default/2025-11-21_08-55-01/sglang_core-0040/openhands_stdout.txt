I’m going to add a lightweight timing script, then optimize memory allocations in the FlashAttention backend by switching expensive zero-initializations to empty buffers, shrinking a large preallocated buffer, and removing unnecessary fills. Finally, I’ll re-run the timing script to show the improvement.
