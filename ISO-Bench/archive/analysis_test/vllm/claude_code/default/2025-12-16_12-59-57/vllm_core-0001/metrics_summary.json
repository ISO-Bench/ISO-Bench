    "summary": "The agent correctly identified the technical optimizations required but was overwhelmed by a pre-existing 'dirty' git state in the environment. Instead of isolating the changes to the three target files, it committed a massive, unrelated merge diff. It essentially performed a 'no-op' on the actual task because the environment was already in the target state.",
