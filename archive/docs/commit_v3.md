# Commit Analysis Status (v3)

## Overview

This document tracks the status of 43 valid commits for Claude Code, Codex, and TRAE agents.

**Dataset:** `ISO-Bench/claude-code-vllm-benchmarks`

**Excluded:**
- 9 commits with wrong perf command
- 1 commit (`6ce01f30`) with corrupted Docker image

## Benchmark Modes and Metrics

Per CLAUDE.md guidelines:
- **Serving mode:** ttft_mean, tpot_mean, itl_mean (lower is better)
- **Standalone mode:** throughput OR latency_avg
- **prefix_caching:** Treated as serving

## Status Definitions

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✓ VALID | Has correct metrics for comparison per benchmark mode |
| WRONG METRIC | Has agent data but wrong metric (e.g., throughput instead of ttft for serving) |
| MISSING human_ttft | Agent has ttft but human_ttft missing from dataset |
| PATCH FAILURE | No agent metrics (patch generation or benchmark failure) |

## Exceptions and Special Cases

| Commit | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| `3476ed08` | Latency-only benchmark - uses `latency_avg` instead of `throughput` (expected) |
| `ce6bf3a2` | `benchmark_mode = None` - mode not classified |
| `ccf02fcb` | `benchmark_mode = None` - mode not classified |
| `19d98e0c` | Missing `human_ttft_mean` - agents have ttft but human only has throughput |
| `89a84b0b` | Missing `human_ttft_mean` - undocumented gap |
| `6e36f4fa` | Missing `human_ttft_mean` - undocumented gap |

**Agent name variations:** Use `agent_name.isin(['claude-code', 'claude_code'])` for Claude Code

## Summary

| Status | Claude Code | Codex | TRAE (Sonnet) | TRAE (GPT) |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| ✓ VALID | 24 | 16 | 16 | 12 |
| WRONG METRIC | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| MISSING human_ttft | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| PATCH FAILURE | 11 | 26 | 26 | 31 |
| **TOTAL** | **43** | **43** | **43** | **43** |

## Key Observations

1. **Claude Code** has 24 valid commits for comparison - highest among all agents

2. **Claude Code** has 5 commits with WRONG METRIC (throughput instead of ttft for serving mode)

3. **Codex and TRAE (Sonnet)** have identical status counts (16 VALID, 26 PATCH FAILURE) because they succeed/fail on exactly the same commits

4. **TRAE (GPT)** has the highest patch failure rate (31/43 = 72.1%)

5. **MISSING human_ttft** affects:
   - `19d98e0c` - documented in README (affects Claude Code, Codex, TRAE-Sonnet)
   - `89a84b0b`, `6e36f4fa` - undocumented gaps (affects Claude Code only)

6. **All agents fail** on 8 commits: ad8d696a, d7740ea4, 660470e5, ce6bf3a2, ccf02fcb, 35fad35a, 6dd94dbe, 9ed82e70

7. **Interesting cases where agents differ:**
   - `e7b20426`: Claude Code PATCH FAILURE, but Codex/TRAE-Sonnet ✓ VALID
   - `8c1e77fb`, `3b61cb45`: Claude Code PATCH FAILURE, but all others ✓ VALID
   - `296f927f`, `70b808fe`: Only Claude Code and TRAE-GPT ✓ VALID

## Agent Comparison

| Metric | Claude Code | Codex | TRAE (Sonnet) | TRAE (GPT) |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| ✓ VALID | 24 (55.8%) | 16 (37.2%) | 16 (37.2%) | 12 (27.9%) |
| Has agent data | 32 (74.4%) | 17 (39.5%) | 17 (39.5%) | 12 (27.9%) |
| Patch failures | 11 (25.6%) | 26 (60.5%) | 26 (60.5%) | 31 (72.1%) |

**Note:** "Has agent data" = ✓ VALID + WRONG METRIC + MISSING human_ttft
