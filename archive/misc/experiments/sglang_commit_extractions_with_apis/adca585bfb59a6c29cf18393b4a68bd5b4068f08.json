  "timeline_text": "Copy link Contributor yuleil commented Apr 11, 2025 Motivation In the --deepep-mode=low_latency mode , final_hidden_states is a tensor with the shape [num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden] , and most of its values are masked. Applying routed_scaling_factor to the entire tensor would result in substantial memory access overhead. The introduction of masked_scale avoids scaling the masked portions, thereby reducing memory access and lowering latency. On H20 running Deepseek-V3-5layers, with EP4, 60 concurrency: Applying routed_scaling_factor to the entire final_hidden_states tooks 350 us: Using masked_scale tooks 36.5 us. Modifications Checklist Format your code according to the Code Formatting with Pre-Commit . Add unit tests as outlined in the Running Unit Tests . Update documentation / docstrings / example tutorials as needed, according to Writing Documentation . Provide throughput / latency benchmark results and accuracy evaluation results as needed, according to Benchmark and Profiling and Accuracy Results .

The commit message \"[DeepEP] Reduce routed scaling overhead\" indicates that the change is intended to decrease the performance overhead of scaling during the expert processing. The change is non-trivial and affects the performance-critical part of the code (i.e., the processing in the DeepseekV2MoE model) while being testable on CPU. It does not merely address a bug or refactor code without performance implication but optimizes the runtime behavior of the model. Therefore, the commit satisfies the conditions for being performance or optimization-related.",
  "llm_api_reason": "The commit changes how the routed scaling factor is applied in the forward method of the DeepseekV2MoE model. Previously, the expert output was scaled directly by multiplication within its call; now the experts are computed without scaling and the scaling is applied after processing (and after the deep expert dispatcher combines outputs). This change affects the behavior of the DeepseekV2MoE.forward API by reducing the overhead in scaling."
